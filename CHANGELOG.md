# Changelog

## 0.4.7 — 2026-05-14

### Installer: fail fast on startup migration drift

- `install.sh` now starts stateful services and the startup authority
  before creating API/worker/frontend dependents, then watches the
  startup container directly. This prevents Compose from sitting forever
  on `service_completed_successfully` dependents when startup restarts.
- Backend images now include the canonical migration SQL files under
  `/app/migrations`, so checksum-drift recovery can apply the exact
  idempotent migration file from the running image before updating
  `_sqlx_migrations.checksum`.

### Ingest: restart-safe large documents and graph encoding

- Stored PDF revisions now extract through durable Docling page-range
units. Completed ranges are reused after worker restart, backend
restart, lease recovery, or transient network loss instead of
discarding already processed pages.
- Long-running ingest attempts now heartbeat from an independent
runtime and finalize only while the attempt still owns the active
lease, preventing stale workers from marking recovered jobs complete.
- Graph extraction now repairs unambiguous UTF-8 transport damage at
the provider boundary and rejects unrepaired mojibake/control
characters before persistence, so corrupted labels do not reach the
graph UI.
- Large graph finalization no longer depends on a blocking full-library
summary refresh; summary refresh is treated as derived cache work.
- Docker Compose now exposes the large-document tuning knobs used by
the runtime: `IRONRAG_DOCLING_PAGE_BATCH_SIZE`,
`IRONRAG_DOCLING_PAGE_STREAM_WINDOW_PAGES`,
`IRONRAG_DOCLING_MAX_CONCURRENCY`,
`IRONRAG_INGESTION_EMBEDDING_PARALLELISM`, and
`IRONRAG_INGESTION_GRAPH_EXTRACT_PARALLELISM_PER_DOC`.

### Documents: processing progress and failure visibility

- Document list rows now expose primary ingest progress and failure
details from the active ingest attempt, so the table can show processing
percentage without an extra polling surface.
- The documents UI fills the existing blue processing status badge as a
compact progress bar and keeps failed-document errors visible in the
document inspector, including the mobile drawer presentation.
- The document inspector now shows processing-stage model names and
costs in readable stacked rows, with billing-derived model attribution
for stages whose lifecycle event did not carry the model directly.
- Document lifecycle now keeps terminal stage timing, zero-cost provider
calls, and stage detail metadata on the read model, so the inspector
shows per-stage duration, model, cost, call count, and extraction/chunk
counts instead of only the aggregate total.
- Document inspector pipeline stages now render as a compact vertical
stage list with inline focused details, active-stage emphasis, and no
horizontal carousel scrolling.
- Billing now resolves provider calls against model catalog entries by
capability, so embedding stages use embedding prices and tiny non-zero
stage costs are not rounded to `$0.0000` in the inspector.
- Ready documents no longer keep the finalizing stage highlighted, stage
rows surface document-level content, embedding, and graph costs across
retries, and inspector actions use compact icon buttons with hover labels.
- Inspector action tooltips now open inside the inspector bounds and wrap
long disabled-action reasons instead of being clipped at the panel edge.
- Ready-document inspectors now show the ready badge without a redundant
100% progress bar, while in-progress documents still show percent and bar.
- Ready PDF, image, and other non-editable document formats now open
from the inspector in a read-only viewer instead of showing a disabled
edit action.
- The document inspector no longer shows the redundant preparation
summary block; action buttons now sit below the processing pipeline with
slightly larger icon targets.
- Document viewer/editor content now treats MIME-typed PDFs as prose,
collapses excessive blank lines, and hides embedded-image OCR scaffolding
from non-image documents so garbled OCR captions do not pollute the
main reading surface.
- Document inspector totals now use the document lifecycle cost, matching
stage rows that include retry/failure spend instead of mixing them with
only the last successful attempt total.

### Assistant: canonical grounded-answer execution

- The UI assistant now executes turns through the same canonical
`QueryService::execute_turn` path as MCP `grounded_answer`, so both
surfaces share query compilation, hybrid retrieval, graph context,
answer generation, verification, citations, caching, and audit records.
- The separate in-process UI MCP-agent path was removed. The session-turn
endpoint now returns the canonical assistant execution detail directly,
and the SSE form emits safe runtime activity events (`started`,
`tool_call_started`, periodic `tool_call_progress`,
`tool_call_finished`, `persisting`) before the terminal `completed` /
`failed` event.
- Query-result cache hits are accepted only when the cached execution is
verified and still has canonical grounding references; stale or
reference-free cache rows are evicted instead of replayed.
- Grounded-answer retrieval now degrades across independent vector and
lexical chunk-search lanes instead of failing the whole assistant/MCP
turn when only one search lane or one lexical subquery has a transient
backend error.
- Query-IR focus chunk searches now degrade like the other additive
retrieval sources: failed focus subqueries are logged, successful focus
hits are retained, and an all-focus failure no longer aborts a turn that
already has primary retrieved chunks.
- Graph evidence text search now preserves the indexed search path for
full-text and literal lookups before applying the library filter,
preventing large evidence tables from falling back to long per-library
scans during grounded answers.
- The admin MCP setup examples and public docs now include Hermes and
explicitly list common MCP-compatible agents such as OpenClaw, Codex,
Cursor, VS Code-based agents, and Claude clients.
- Assistant turns now recover from mid-stream browser/proxy transport
drops by loading the completed durable session result after the request
boundary, while explicit backend `failed` events still surface as real
errors.
- Assistant LLM debug context is now persisted per query execution, so
the debug view can show the exact provider prompt, tool activity,
messages, response, and usage even after reloads or cached answer
replays.
- `/v1/ready` now validates Postgres migration state against the
embedded migrations in the running binary and returns degraded/503 on
checksum drift, missing migrations, dirty migration rows, or unexpected
applied versions instead of reporting a false Ready state.

### Provider credentials: allow custom baseUrl overrides

> Reported by [@dkomchenko](https://github.com/dkomchenko).

- Fixed a regression where hosted providers rejected explicit `baseUrl`
overrides with `...does not allow baseUrl overrides`.
- Creating/updating provider credentials now accepts explicit `baseUrl`
overrides for all providers; when no override is supplied, runtime still
falls back to each provider's catalog default URL.

### Docker build: incremental compilation and profile tuning

- `target/` cache mount in the builder stage persists compiled
Rust artifacts across `docker build` runs.  Combined with
`CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_INCREMENTAL=true`, Cargo rebuilds only the
crates whose source files actually changed — 5–10× faster than a
cold build on the second iteration.
- **Release-profile overrides** (`incremental=true`, `codegen-units=256`,
`opt-level=2`) are set via environment variables so the public-release
Dockerfile inherits the defaults without a custom Cargo profile.
- **Three-stage Dockerfile** isolates the heavyweight docling/Python
warmup from the Rust builder, so changing application code no longer
re-downloads HuggingFace models.

### Docling timeout: raised default and env-override

> Reported by [@VasKorotkov](https://github.com/VasKorotkov).

- Raised `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_SECS` from 300 s → 900 s so Docling has
enough headroom for large PDFs with OCR.
- The timeout is already overridable via `IRONRAG_DOCLING_TIMEOUT_SECS`.

### Vector index: dimension reconciliation and health probe

- `ensure_vector_index_reconcile` compares the active embedding
model dimension with the existing ArangoDB index and drops+recreates
when they diverge.  Driven by the resolved `dimensions` field in
`ai_model_catalog.metadata_json`.
- **Health probe** (`probe_vector_index`) tests `APPROX_NEAR_COSINE` at
startup and logs an error when the index is corrupted — operators see
a clear signal instead of silent zero-hit retrievals.
- `known_embedding_dimensions` stamps OpenAI embedding model sizes
(3072 / 1536) into the catalog during provider discovery.
- **API binding change detection:** creating or updating an
`embed_chunk` binding now returns `embeddingDimensionChanged: true`
(with previous/new dimensions) when the new model's vector size
differs, so the UI can warn the operator.
- **UI toast** on the admin AI panel shows «Размерность векторов
изменена…» when the binding response carries the flag.

### Re-upload after soft delete

> Reported by [@VasKorotkov](https://github.com/VasKorotkov).

- Replaced the unconditional `UNIQUE(library_id, external_key)`
constraint with a **partial index** (`WHERE document_state = 'active'`)
so a soft-deleted document no longer blocks re-uploading the same
file (migration `0008`).

### Swagger UI: iframe isolation

> Reported by [@VasKorotkov](https://github.com/VasKorotkov).

- Swagger UI is now served as a **standalone HTML page**
(`public/swagger.html`) loading `swagger-ui-dist` locally and
embedded via `<iframe>`.  This completely isolates the vendor
stylesheet from Tailwind preflight, which was collapsing operation
tags into empty lists.

### Admin AI panel: scroll and optional-binding warnings

> Reported by [@VasKorotkov](https://github.com/VasKorotkov).

- The bindings/presets/credentials content area now has `overflow-auto`
so small viewports can scroll the AI configuration tab.
- A **warning banner** appears when optional bindings (`extract_text`,
`vision`) are not configured: keep raster-image OCR on the Docling
engine unless the library is explicitly routed to `vision`; a missing
vision binding fails loudly.

## 0.4.6 — 2026-05-11

### Fix: LoginPage TypeError on fresh stack with the new Agent purpose

- `**bootstrapPurposeMetadata` was missing an `agent` entry**, so when
the bootstrap bundle preview iterated its presets the `Record<...>`
lookup returned `undefined` and `LoginPage.tsx:553` threw
`TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'labelKey')`,
collapsing the auth view into the error boundary on a fresh stack.
v0.4.5 added Agent to `AiBindingPurpose` (and the bootstrap synthesis
pipeline) but left this purpose-metadata table behind. v0.4.6 adds
the missing entry, declares Agent on `BootstrapBindingPurpose` in the
generated TS types so the `satisfies` check covers it, and ships
`login.purposeAgent` / `login.purposeAgentDesc` in `ru.json` and
`en.json`.

## 0.4.5 — 2026-05-11

### UI assistant: complete the MCP-agent wiring + chat-model role recompute

- `**AiBindingPurpose::Agent` is now a first-class required runtime
binding.** v0.4.4 shipped migration 0006 that added the `agent` enum
value but left half of the binding wiring incomplete: the admin UI
did not list the purpose, the compile-time required-binding-purpose list
did not include it, and `BootstrapBindingPurpose` had a deliberate
`unreachable!()` for it. As a result every UI-assistant turn 409'd
with `library X has no active 'agent' binding configured`. v0.4.5
promotes Agent to the primary required tier on both ends:
`PURPOSE_ORDER` / `REQUIRED_RUNTIME_PURPOSE_ORDER` / i18n labels in
`apps/web`, plus `BootstrapBindingPurpose::Agent` + bootstrap preset
synthesis cloned from the active `query_answer` profile (Agent
shadows QueryAnswer-class chat models with tool-loop semantics).
- **Migration 0007 recomputes chat-model `defaultRoles`** so every
`chat`/`text` model in `ai_model_catalog` advertises the standard
text-chat purpose set (`extract_text` + `extract_graph` +
`query_compile` + `query_answer` + `agent`); multimodal chat models
also include `vision`. Migration 0005 had frozen newer chat models
with a narrower legacy purpose set, which is why the admin UI
refused to surface them under `extract_text` even when the provider
clearly supported it.
- **Idempotent Agent backfill.** Same migration walks every active
`query_answer` binding (instance / workspace / library) and inserts
a paired `agent` binding pointing at the same credential and a new
`<Provider> Agent · <model>` preset, on conflict do nothing. Existing
stacks become Agent-ready on the next startup without any operator
action.
- **Reasoner-class `reasoning_content` echo.** Some chat APIs
(notably the hosted reasoner backend that fronts the `*-flash` /
`*-pro` family) reject the second tool-loop turn with HTTP 400
`The 'reasoning_content' in the thinking mode must be passed back to the API` if the assistant message in the prior history strips
the field. `ChatMessage` and `ToolUseResponse` now carry an optional
`reasoning_content`, the OpenAI-compatible gateway parses + echoes
it, and the in-process MCP-agent loop builds the assistant turn via
`assistant_with_reasoning_and_tool_calls(...)` so reasoner multi-turn
runs cleanly. Non-reasoner providers ignore the optional field on
the wire.
- **Provider-aware `tool_choice` policy.** Reasoner-class models
reject `tool_choice="required"` with HTTP 400 (`* does not support this tool_choice`). The unified gateway now sends
`tool_choice="auto"` on those providers and `tool_choice="required"`
only on chat-class models on the first agent iteration when the
loop has not yet produced a tool call.
- **Library ref auto-injection for the in-process agent.** The shared
`grounded_answer` MCP descriptor lists `library` as required because
external MCP clients pick which library their token addresses. The
UI agent always operates inside one fixed library; we now strip
`library` from the schema we hand to the LLM and auto-inject the
unified `<workspace_slug>/<library_slug>` ref before invoking the
tool. The model is freed from inventing identifiers it cannot know,
and the call resolves deterministically.
- **Provider-error body is no longer swallowed.** `sanitize_provider_error_detail`
used to return the placeholder `upstream provider request failed; response body was not included` even when the body had no
credential markers — making 4xx provider responses undebuggable. It
now preserves the body when no marker matches and only redacts when
it actually finds an `sk-` / `Bearer` / `Authorization` / `api_key`
fragment, so operators can read structured provider errors directly
from logs.

## 0.4.4 — 2026-05-10

### Install: detect & explain sqlx migration checksum drift

- `install.sh` now polls the backend health endpoint after `docker compose up -d` and watches `ironrag-startup-1` for the familiar
sqlx error `migration N was previously applied but has been modified`. If the recorded DB checksum diverges from the file
bundled in the new release image, the script prints the offending
migration version, the exact `sha384sum` and `UPDATE _sqlx_migrations` commands needed to recover, stops the stack, and
exits non-zero — the previous behaviour left the operator staring
at an indefinite `Container ironrag-startup-1 Waiting`.

## 0.4.3 — 2026-05-10

### Embedded picture OCR via the active vision binding

- **PDF screenshots, diagrams, and image-only blocks now reach the
graph.** Until v0.4.2 the Docling adapter dropped embedded raster
pictures behind `<!-- image -->` placeholders and the local
rapidocr / tesseract fallback could only handle simple cases. v0.4.3
routes every embedded picture through the active `vision` binding —
the same multimodal LLM the operator already configured for
image-file uploads — so screenshots of UI flows, JSON payload
examples, and configuration tables are OCR'd at multimodal-LLM
recall, not at small-CPU-OCR-model recall.
- Docling's Python extractor now exposes each picture as a
base64-encoded PNG alongside its placeholder ordinal. The Rust
ingest pipeline iterates the list, calls
`extraction::image::extract_image_with_provider` per picture (same
helper as the standalone-image route), and appends the per-picture
text to the document's `content_text` so chunking, embedding, and
graph extraction see it. Cost per call is the same as one image
upload (~$0.001 with `gpt-5.4-mini` vision); for a typical PDF
with 5–10 embedded pictures the augmentation adds <$0.01 to the
document.
- The local rapidocr / tesseract fallback is preserved for offline
deployments and runs first; the vision-binding pass replaces those
snippets when the binding is configured. Cyrillic / CJK / Latin
Rec model selection from v0.4.2 stays in place.
- Failures on individual pictures (provider error, content moderation
rejection) are logged into the extraction warnings array and do not
fail the document — the rest of the pictures and the text layer
proceed.

### Multi-provider catalog

- Provider catalog ships seven profiles (OpenAI, DeepSeek,
Qwen / DashScope-intl, GPTunnel, OpenRouter, RouterAI, Ollama)
declared in `ai_provider_catalog` with capability flags, runtime
paths, model-discovery configuration, and bootstrap-preset list.
- Multimodal chat models (`gpt-4o`, `claude-4-*`, `gemini-3.x`,
`qwen3-vl`, `pixtral`, `llama4-vision`, `mistral-medium`/`-large`,
and similar) carry the `vision` purpose in `defaultRoles` and
`multimodal` modality, so they can be bound to the `vision`
pipeline purpose from the admin UI.
- Setting `IRONRAG_<PROVIDER>_API_KEY` in `.env` is sufficient to
register a credential — startup creates one instance-scope
`Bootstrap <DisplayName>` credential per provider, idempotently
(`ai_catalog::ensure_env_provider_credentials`).
- Catalog stores prices per `(model_catalog_id, billing_unit)` in
USD. Per-call billing rows are written for every LLM request and
rolled up per document and per query in the UI.
- Catalog-level capability validation: writing a binding requires
the chosen model to declare the binding's purpose in
`defaultRoles`; `embed_chunk` and `query_retrieve` are upserted
as a paired counterpart on every write.
- New end-to-end harness `apps/api/scripts/multi-provider-e2e.py`
exercises one provider at a time on a self-contained workspace +
library: upload → ingest → `extract_graph` → grounded answer,
asserting the answer references the expected entities.

### Provider router and bootstrap readiness

#### Added

- OpenAI-compatible provider-router profiles can now describe runtime
paths, credential policy, base URL policy, model discovery, bootstrap
presets, and provider capabilities from one unified catalog model.
- First-run setup exposes AI bootstrap bundles through the generated
contract surface, including the full runtime purpose vocabulary:
`extract_text`, `extract_graph`, `embed_chunk`, `query_compile`,
`query_retrieve`, `query_answer`, and `vision`.

#### Changed

- Library shell readiness now separates ingest prerequisites from runtime
query readiness. Missing runtime bindings are surfaced as distinct
purposes, and `query_retrieve` is handled as an embedding-style runtime
purpose instead of being collapsed into answer generation.
- Provider runtime profiles now expose `structuredOutput` through the
shared contract, OpenAPI schema, and generated TypeScript client, so
JSON-schema, JSON-object, and unsupported structured-output modes use
one shared provider profile field.
- The admin AI and bootstrap frontend paths now consume generated API
types at the boundary, with provider catalog validation for capability
and credential metadata instead of duplicate raw response DTOs.
- Web ingest run parameters, document detail adapters, graph topology
adapters, and admin catalog surfaces now use the generated contract
types instead of hand-shaped raw response DTOs.
- Document list status/readiness, document readiness summaries, graph
topology loading, source-access mapping, and snapshot import reports
now use generated contract types across backend and web
boundaries.
- Async operation status now uses a typed shared enum in the backend
contract and generated frontend API instead of raw string DTOs.

#### Fixed

- Missing `query_compile`, `query_retrieve`, or `query_answer` bindings
now make `queryReady` false without making ingest readiness report a
query-only failure.
- Runtime query embeddings now use the active `query_retrieve` binding
and fail loud when it does not target the same vector source as
`embed_chunk`, preventing silent empty-vector retrieval after a binding
change. The query-embedding cache is scoped by provider catalog, model,
credential, and base URL.
- Bootstrap presets and admin binding writes now enforce the same
vector-model invariant for `embed_chunk` and `query_retrieve` before
the runtime can enter a broken retrieval state.
- Grounded-answer retrieval fixed release-blocking regressions around
over-eager clarification, same-stem multi-format document targeting,
graph namespace endpoint disambiguation, and multi-document comparison
truncation.
- QueryIR routing now consumes one unified target vocabulary, including
source-slice row requests, instead of accepting alias ladders or raw
question wording as a parallel routing path.
- Graph extraction now validates the entity/relation schema
exactly and stores only schema-defined relation types, removing parser
aliases and provider-specific structured-output fallbacks.
- First-run setup now blocks completion until a ready provider bundle is
loaded and selected; credential-discovered provider models no longer
make valid configured bindings look missing before credential-scoped
discovery has returned.
- Bootstrap and admin UI errors no longer render raw backend/provider
messages in the main operator path.
- Provider model discovery now uses declared discovery capability paths
instead of model-name heuristics, so opaque router model identifiers
are preserved and classified by the provider profile contract.
- Vector binding lifecycle updates now keep `embed_chunk` and
`query_retrieve` counterparts in sync for active, inactive, update,
and delete paths instead of leaving stale runtime assignments behind.
- UI and MCP grounded-answer probes now send the same retrieval depth by
default, keeping parity measurements tied to the same runtime shape.
- Agent-surface and release-readiness probes now call MCP graph and
document tools with primary catalog library references instead of
stale UUID alias fields.
- Agent-surface probes now execute the primary assistant JSON turn
endpoint instead of waiting for obsolete UI SSE completion frames.
- MCP `grounded_answer` structured output now embeds the same
assistant execution detail instead of maintaining a parallel evidence
projection, restoring evidence-reference parity with the UI assistant turn
payload.
- Agent-surface release gates now avoid over-specific graph-search
top-label and broad negative-token assertions when the grounded answer,
verifier, runtime id, and reference parity checks already cover the
user-visible contract.
- Agent-surface reports no longer include the stale SSE-era tool-start
budget after the assistant probe moved to the primary JSON turn
endpoint.
- Grounded-answer generation now explicitly preserves source-evidence
polarity for existence and capability questions; the live technical
benchmark now checks answer-opening polarity and no longer rejects
correct negated mentions of an unavailable endpoint as forbidden content.
- Standalone assistant questions no longer inherit entity anchors from the
previous assistant answer, so topic changes inside one conversation keep
retrieval focused on the current question while follow-up questions still
use conversation context.
- Grounded-answer prompts now preserve source bindings for multi-role
questions instead of substituting adjacent workflow components when a
direct source document answers the requested role.
- Docling extraction now treats image-placeholder-only markdown as empty
and uses the available text layer as the primary extracted content,
preserving PDF/DOCX text when markdown conversion emits only placeholders.
- Document search now runs expanded lexical chunk probes and evidence
hydration with bounded parallelism and batch-loads document/revision
metadata, reducing release-gate latency without changing the
ranking model.
- Document search now honors `evidenceSampleLimit=0`, runs independent
lexical/entity/relation/provider stages concurrently, caps vector probes
to the requested response surface, and uses term-bounded revision
backfill instead of full-revision scans.
- Live grounded benchmark GET requests now refresh the HTTP session and
retry transient connection drops, so idempotent search probes do not
abort a release run after a closed keepalive socket.
- Snapshot import now authorizes the target library before accepting a
restore and only imports manifest-declared export sections, closing
dynamic table/collection import gaps.
- Snapshot export no longer includes AI provider credentials or runtime
binding state; provider access remains deployment configuration rather
than portable library data.
- Snapshot restore now validates row ownership, declared blob scope, and
graph edge endpoints before import; replace restores also quarantine
old library blobs so stale objects cannot be served after a restore.

### Frontend modernization

#### Added

- Shared server-state now uses TanStack Query 5, code-first OpenAPI from `utoipa`, and a generated TypeScript SDK from `@hey-api/openapi-ts`.
- Storybook 8, MSW-backed API mocks for tests, Sentry-compatible observability, lazy route loading, a gzip bundle budget, and the `make frontend-check` CI gate now cover the web app.

#### Changed

- Frontend ownership is vertical under `apps/web/src/{app,features,shared}`: feature code lives in `src/features/<feature>/`, and reusable API, component, and hook surfaces live in `src/shared/{api,components,hooks}/`.
- ESLint hard-blocks ad-hoc `useEffect` + `fetch` and `useEffect` + `*Api` server-state loops.
- The main bundle budget is calibrated to 220 KB gzip after transitive dependency growth.

#### Fixed

- Ten components were migrated off ad-hoc `useEffect` + `fetch` loops onto the shared server-state path.
- Sentry-compatible initialization no longer lands in the eager bundle; it loads behind `requestIdleCallback` via dynamic import.

### Assistant transient-network handling

- The assistant turn dispatcher no longer surfaces a long
blame-the-browser placeholder ("Browser blocked the request to the
server. Typical causes: extension, tracking protection, corporate
proxy…") on every transient fetch failure. Pre-fetch network
rejects (`NetworkError`, `Failed to fetch`, `Load failed` — the
request never reached the server) are now retried once
transparently in the same handler. Anything that fails after that
surfaces with the raw error message via the existing retry banner,
so operators see the actual cause instead of a misleading
extension-blame guess. Removed the unused
`assistant.errorDiagnosis.*` i18n strings.

## 0.4.1 — 2026-05-03

### Ollama provider catalog: full library coverage

- **68 Ollama models registered out of the box** across the major
families: Qwen3 (0.6B–32B + Coder), Qwen2.5 (0.5B–72B + Coder), QwQ
reasoning, Llama 3.1 / 3.2 / 3.3, Mistral / Mistral-Nemo, Mixtral
8x7B / 8x22B, Gemma 2 / Gemma 3, Phi 3 / 3.5 / 4 / 4-mini, DeepSeek-R1
(1.5B–70B reasoning), DeepSeek-Coder-V2, IBM Granite 3.3, plus
vision (Qwen2.5VL / Qwen3-VL, Llama 3.2-Vision, LLaVA, MiniCPM-V,
Moondream) and embedding (Qwen3-embedding, nomic-embed-text,
mxbai-embed-large, bge-m3, snowflake-arctic-embed2, all-minilm,
granite-embedding) families. Models not yet `ollama pull`-ed appear
in the UI dropdown anyway; selecting one and saving the binding
triggers `ollama pull` on first use.
- **Default roles per model size and capability.** ≥4B chat models gain
the full set `extract_graph,query_answer,query_compile,utility,rerank`
so a single local model can serve every text purpose; <4B chat models
get `extract_graph,query_answer,utility` because they cannot reliably
emit the structured-JSON schemas used by `query_compile` and
`rerank`; reasoning models (DeepSeek-R1, QwQ) get
`query_answer,query_compile,utility`; vision models get
`extract_graph,query_answer,vision`; embedding models keep
`embed_chunk` only.
- **Bootstrap presets.** Each registered model gets an instance-scoped
preset named `Ollama <model>`, so the UI binding picker shows a
ready-to-select option per model without operator setup. 75 Ollama
presets total after seeding (was 7 in 0.4.0).

### Catalog parser hardening

- The `defaultRoles` parser used by `resolve_active_runtime_binding`
no longer treats unknown role labels (e.g. forward-compatible
`rerank` / `utility` from new Ollama seeds) as fatal catalog
corruption. A single unmapped role used to silently return
`ApiError::Internal`, which propagated as a bare "internal server
error" through every binding lookup that listed the model catalog
— breaking embed_chunk and extract_graph for fresh ingest jobs and
surfacing in the admin AI tab as "failed to load AI configuration".
Unknown labels are now skipped.

### Documents header cost summary

- Library and workspace totals always render together when the cost
banner is shown, so a library with no billed executions yet (e.g.
attachments still queued) no longer looks like the library cost
field "disappeared" — both rows render with the standard
`$0.000` placeholder while workspace totals remain visible.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-05-03

### Highlights

- Temporal hard-filter for `record_jsonl` chats and any document with
`occurred_at` headers — date-anchored questions now return only chunks
whose timestamp overlaps the requested window.
- Ordered source-slice (`source_slice` head/tail/all) honours the same
temporal bounds, so "last 20 messages in March 2026" returns the
chronological tail within March, not the tail of the file.
- Vector-row temporal mirror: ANN post-sieve filters directly on the
candidate without a per-row chunk lookup; `over_fetch` returns to 8×
default and gains a hard 8 192 cap.
- Defence-in-depth tenant isolation on every cross-revision lookup:
`library_id` filter is now in the AQL itself, not just in the caller.
- Disambiguation gate is bypassed when the question carries resolved
temporal bounds — date-scoped turns now return a grounded answer or a
clean refusal instead of the off-topic "could be one of: X, Y, Z" reply.

### Retrieval and answer quality

- `QueryIR.temporal_constraints` (compiled from natural language by the
LLM compiler, RFC3339 bounds) is consumed end-to-end: lexical lane,
vector lane, source-unit slice loader, and library-source-profile
fallback. Helper `QueryIR::resolved_temporal_bounds()` aggregates
`min(start)` / `max(end)`; structural RFC3339 parsing only — no NL
word lists.
- AQL adds `FILTER ... occurred_at ... occurred_until ...` to all four
`search_chunks` lanes (text view, title-identity, title-soft, backstop)
and to `search_chunk_vectors_by_similarity`. RFC3339 strings sort
lexicographically equal to chronological order.
- Source-unit slice (`apply_ordered_source_slice_context`) now resolves a
record-stream candidate at library scope when no top-K chunk is a
record stream, then filters head/tail blocks via AQL substring match
on `occurred_at=ISO` headers.
- Search ranking uses generic, language-agnostic best-chunk and
top-chunk evidence-coverage signals; document-search no longer carries
corpus-specific query expansions or topic boosts.
- Deterministic technical answers abstain unless the candidate covers
the typed technical facets requested by `QueryIR` and grounded in
evidence.
- Document targeting normalizes filename separators and natural phrasing
to the same primary document identity through deterministic
longest-match scoring.

### Grounded-answer prompt and policy

- Multi-entity disambiguation rule: the prompt now requires the LLM to
enumerate every distinct entity in context that matches the queried
name, including incidental references inside long chunks; collapsing
them or silently picking the most prominent one is forbidden.
- Live ingest metadata is no longer injected into the answer prompt.
Recent-documents data with mutating `pipeline_state` and
`preview_excerpt` drifted between back-to-back identical calls and
produced divergent UI/MCP answers; the prompt is now a deterministic
function of `(query, retrieved evidence, library summary)`. Locked by
`assemble_answer_context_excludes_recent_documents_for_mcp_ui_parity`.
- `grounded_answer` MCP and UI now use the same `top_k=24` default —
prior 8 vs 24 split was a constitutional §16 parity violation.

### Multiformat ingestion

- Spreadsheet extraction is native-only for `csv`, `tsv`, `xls`, `xlsx`,
`xlsb`, `ods`. Docling adapter is reserved for document-layout formats
and configured raster-image OCR.
- Grounded multiformat benchmark covers PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX with
sheet-level table questions.
- Reprocess parses stored source bytes first and falls back to derived
text only when no source blob is available; record-stream reprocess
derives JSONL from prepared source-unit blocks instead of degrading to
plain text.
- Append processing is diff-aware: persists a source blob for future
retries and reuses unchanged chunk embeddings and graph extraction
records by normalized chunk content.

### Graph extraction quality

- Script-preserving extract (v8): labels and endpoints are copied
verbatim from prepared chunk text; source writing is never converted
into another writing system; look-alike glyph substitution is
forbidden. Bumping the version invalidates older cache entries.
- OCR text quality gate: structural quality score, low-confidence
blocks skipped from summaries, chunks downranked, graph extraction
drops or avoids low-confidence artifacts. Reuse and reconcile paths
apply the same eligibility policy.
- Graph extraction reuse is keyed by rendered prompt + active
provider/model contract, not mutable database row ids. Storage-row
noise no longer invalidates legitimate reuse.
- Coreference rule rewritten language-neutrally: short anaphoric
references resolve structurally to the previously named entity
without enumerating language-specific word lists.
- Record-stream graph extraction is bounded structurally to source
profile + first/last + fact-supported + evenly spaced units.

### Schema and operations

- `content_chunk` gains `occurred_at TIMESTAMPTZ`, `occurred_until TIMESTAMPTZ`, partial index `idx_content_chunk_occurred_at`, and a
range check constraint. PG and Arango chunk row mirror these fields;
ingest populates them from `record_jsonl::extract_chunk_temporal_bounds`.
- `KnowledgeChunkVectorRow` mirrors `occurred_at` / `occurred_until` so
the ANN sieve operates on the candidate row directly.
- `ironrag-backfill-chunk-temporal-bounds` binary: idempotent, cursor-
paginated, Arango-first then PG-flip so failed mirrors stay
retry-eligible; non-zero exit on partial completion.
- `ironrag-gc-stale-chunks` rewrites the library-wide AQL into per-
document batches with `chunk.document_id == ?` and
`vector.revision_id IN @stale`, fitting comfortably under the Arango
per-query memory cap on libraries that previously OOMed.
- Library-scoped record-stream fallback in
`first_record_stream_candidate_profile` finds record-stream profiles
for the active library revision even when no top-K chunk is record-stream.
- `list_source_profile_chunks_by_revisions` AQL now filters by
`library_id` for defence-in-depth tenant isolation.

### Reprocess and append

- Concurrent answer cache fills are single-owner; identical grounded-
answer turns wait for the active fill instead of starting duplicate
fill executions. Coordination failures fail loudly.
- Embedding coverage is verified after reuse: partial-vector revisions
become explicit ingest failures instead of later retrieval misses.
- Reprocess works for text-recoverable revisions without source blobs;
documents with neither stored source nor recoverable text fail loudly.
- Ingest concurrency defaults are bounded for CPU-only hosts.

### Webhooks and operations

- Inbound webhook receiver removed; outbound delivery only. Outbound
pipeline hardened with retries, idempotency, and image_checksum on
delivered events.
- Web-ingest runs carry a single `urlFilter` snapshot with explicit
`blocklist`/`allowlist` mode; documents UI rejects empty allowlists.
- Workspace cost rollup, searchable workspace/library selectors, and
evidence-gated comparison answers landed.

### Assistant transport

- UI assistant uses one direct JSON `POST /v1/query/sessions/{id}/turns`
request — no SSE branch in the primary JSON path. MCP streaming remains
isolated under `/v1/mcp`. Session history hydrates from
`{ session, messages }` so existing conversations restore correctly.

### Tests

- 959 lib tests (was 953 in 0.3.2). New unit coverage for
`resolved_temporal_bounds` (full-range, half-open start, half-open
end, mixed parseable/unparseable, empty), and rewritten orphan-only
contract for `map_chunk_hit` / `map_companion_chunk` (drops chunks
only when the document has no head pointer; runtime is now lenient
on revision-id mismatch since strict equality silently hid ~80% of
chunks for documents with overlapping incremental revisions).

## 0.3.2 — 2026-04-24

### Web ingest

- **Library-owned web ingest ignore policy.** A new `web_ingest_policy`
JSONB column on `catalog_library` stores per-library ignore patterns
(`url_prefix`, `path_prefix`, `glob`). The hardcoded
`classify_confluence_system_page` helper is replaced by a dynamic
matcher in `shared/web/ingest.rs`. New endpoint:
`PUT /v1/catalog/libraries/{libraryId}/web-ingest-policy`.
- **Per-run extra ignore patterns.** Each ingest run can carry
additional patterns on top of the library default, stored in
`content_web_ingest_run.ignore_patterns` and merged at match time.
- `**WebIngestRunSummary.ignorePatterns`** is a required field in the
OpenAPI contract; UI surfaces the active ignore policy in the
web-runs panel.

### Reliability & operability

- **Null-head recovery** (`ironrag-promote-null-heads`): idempotent CLI
that promotes `document_head` for any document whose head is NULL but
whose latest revision has persisted chunks.
- **Fail-loud Postgres ↔ Arango head sync.** `promote_knowledge_document`
now returns `Result<(), ApiError>`; silent warn-on-fail is gone.
Regression test asserts the error path when Arango is unreachable.
- **Fail-soft post-answer reference hydration.** Transient Arango errors
during reference-panel lookups no longer flip a 200-answered turn
into a 500 after the answer body has streamed.
- **Reverse-proxy POST fix.** Dropped `proxy_request_buffering off`
from `nginx.conf.template`; POSTs on `/v1/query/sessions` and
`/v1/mcp` no longer hang for 15 s behind the proxy.
- **ArangoDB memory caps** pinned in compose and Helm
(`--query.memory-limit`, RocksDB caps separate) — eliminates the
5-parallel-turn OOM on small hosts.
- **Pool / threading tuning.** `TOKIO_WORKER_THREADS` default 2 → 8;
heartbeat pool 6 → 24 with 15 s acquire_timeout, removing the reaper
false-positive that was releasing healthy leases under merge load.

### Retrieval quality

- **QueryIR routing.** `QueryCompilerService` compiles the
natural-language question into a typed `QueryIR` (act / scope /
target_types / literal_constraints / confidence); downstream stages
read routing signals from the IR instead of re-classifying the raw
string. Replaces scattered keyword classifiers.
- **Entity-bio fan-out for biographical queries.** When the IR carries a
named target entity (proper noun), retrieval fans out over graph
evidence plus a lexical pass by entity label, and post-filters to
keep only chunks that literally contain the label. Single-word
surname queries now surface every corpus mention rather than the
top BM25 hit. Capitalized mentions take precedence over common
concept nouns when both are present.
- **Title-aware BM25 boost + ngram fuzzy title match.** Typos in
product or proper-noun titles no longer shred recall; the ngram
analyzer on `title` / `file_name` plus a separate title-token
BM25 boost keeps the intended document in top-K.
- **Real chunk embedding in ingest** with library-wide vector filter.
Vector search no longer silently matches stale embeddings from
other libraries.
- **Lexical fallback scan only on view-lag**, bounded bind vars.
Full-scan triggers only when the ArangoSearch view is behind the
freshness budget.
- **Parallel tool dispatch + atomic topology prewarm.** The grounded-
answer tool loop dispatches independent calls in parallel; graph
topology cache is prewarmed atomically at boot.
- **Revision-coherence gate hardened.** `map_chunk_hit` is strict on
strict revision equality, backed by the null-head recovery above.

### Ingest performance

- **Bulk-upsert in merge.** One-shot bulk preload of runtime graph nodes by stable merge keys
preload plus `bulk_upsert_runtime_graph_nodes` replace ~35 sequential
round-trips per chunk; +112 % throughput and −71 % slow statements
on an internal stress stack.
- **Stuck-document terminal marker** with extended backoff: the
stale-lease reaper stops reactivating revisions that have
deterministically failed extraction.
- `**sub_type_hints` cache** (60 s TTL, per `(library_id, projection_version)`)
drops a per-batch Postgres aggregate from the slow-statement log.
- **Bulk chunk-vector UPSERT** per embedding batch replaces the
previous per-row round-trip.

### Assistant UX

- **SSE transport fallback.** When the browser or proxy blocks SSE,
the UI falls back to non-streaming POST and shows an inline retry
alert instead of a NetworkError dead-end.
- **Evidence panel relevance formatter** distinguishes normalized
probabilities (0..1 → percent) from raw BM25 scores (> 1 → decimal);
fixes the `6384 %` overflow for high-BM25 hits.
- **SSE keep-alive 15 s → 3 s.** The longer interval was racing with
Firefox Enhanced Tracking Protection's idle close on large-corpus
retrievals, producing `stream ended without a completed frame`.
- **Assistant i18n.** Diagnosis and error strings moved into the
translation layer; no hardcoded locale text remains in the UI.
- **Operations admin panel simplified.** Noisy status badges, pill
banners, and verbose audit rows removed in favour of a compact
one-line-per-event view.

### Miscellaneous

- Optional `query_compile` and `vision` bindings.
- Graph extraction parser accepts alternative field names from
smaller models.
- Billing, `/v1/content/web-runs`, and graph-cache perf fixes that
were causing concurrent-request timeouts.
- Tuning knobs centralised in `services/query/execution/tuning.rs`.
- Clippy-clean.

### Measured

- Grounded-answer parity benchmark passes on both UI and MCP lanes
for clarify + provider follow-ups + release-history scenarios on
the internal stress corpus.
- Concurrency stress (5 parallel turns): 5 / 5 × 200, p95 21 s;
previously 0 / 5 × 500 with ArangoDB OOM.

## 0.3.1 — 2026-04-17

### QueryCompiler: NL → typed QueryIR replaces hardcoded keyword classifiers

The fix replaces the scattered keyword-based routing with a single unified layer: a compiled `QueryIR` (act, scope, target_types, literal_constraints, conversation_refs, confidence) produced by a new `QueryCompilerService` from the natural-language question. Every downstream stage now reads routing signals from the IR instead of re-classifying the raw question string.

- `**QueryIR` schema.** Finite enums for `act` (retrieve_value, describe, configure_how, compare, enumerate, meta, follow_up), `scope`, `language`, `literal_kind`, `entity_role`, `conversation_ref_kind`. Open-ended ontology tags for `target_types` and `comparison.dimension` so new concepts enter through data, not code. Strict OpenAI-compatible JSON Schema (`domains/query_ir.rs::query_ir_json_schema`) generated by hand so the compiler output validates under structured-output strict mode.
- `**QueryCompilerService`.** Stateless service in `services/query/compiler.rs` that calls whatever model the operator binds to the new `AiBindingPurpose::QueryCompile` — no model is hardcoded in code. Falls back to a safe `Describe` IR with `confidence: 0.0` when the binding is missing, the provider is down, or the model returns invalid JSON, so the pipeline keeps working in degraded mode.
- **Two-tier IR cache** (`migrations/0003_query_ir_cache.sql`). SHA-256 of normalised question + history fingerprint + `QUERY_IR_SCHEMA_VERSION`. Redis hot tier with 24 h TTL, Postgres persistent tier keyed by `(library_id, question_hash)` for cross-session reuse and debugging. Fallback outcomes are never cached. Cache hits carry `provider_kind` sentinels (`cache:redis` / `cache:postgres`) so diagnostics distinguish them from LLM runs.
- **Verification guard now driven by IR.** `verify_generated_answer` reads `QueryIR::verification_level()` → `Strict / Moderate / Lenient`. Only `RetrieveValue` requests with explicit `literal_constraints` stay in strict suppression mode; `ConfigureHow`, `Describe`, `Enumerate` drop to lenient (warnings in metadata, answer reaches the user). The hardcoded gremlin/sparql/cypher/2019 branch in `verification.rs::question_specific_verification_warnings` and its twin answer-builder branch in `answer.rs` are gone — that benchmark case is now covered by the general `unsupported_literal` path at strict level.
- **Consumer migration (9 files).** `search.rs::strong_markers` (15 words), `answer.rs::build_graph_query_language_answer`, `table_row_answer.rs::is_value_inventory_request` (10), `document_target.rs::is_multi_document_comparison` (57), and `technical_literal_focus.rs::ignored_keywords` (37) now route on `QueryIR` fields instead of keyword lists. `planner.rs::STOP_WORDS` (48) and `SYNONYM_GROUPS` (24) were removed — the ontology-aware `target_types` in the IR replace the synonym union and a language-agnostic `TOKEN_MIN_LEN = 3` replaces the stop-word filter. `service/mod.rs::PREPARED_SEGMENT_FOCUS_STOPWORDS` (22 EN+RU entries) and the three `session.rs` follow-up marker lists (38 + 27 + 13) were replaced with length cutoffs; the real follow-up signal lives in `QueryIR.conversation_refs`. `service/session.rs::COMMON_WORDS` (46 English filters) deleted from entity extraction.
- **Observability.** `LlmContextSnapshot.query_ir` surfaces the compiled IR in the debug panel alongside LLM iterations. Structured tracing event `ironrag::query_compile` carries act / scope / target_types / confidence per compile. `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]`-only `validate_ir` enforces schema invariants (Compare → comparison present, FollowUp → refs or low confidence, confidence ∈ [0, 1]).
- **Eval gate.** `tests/query_ir_golden.jsonl` holds 330 hand-labelled questions (202 en / 128 ru, balanced across all seven acts). `tests/query_ir_golden_parses.rs` is a CI gate: every golden row must deserialise into `QueryIR`. `tests/query_compiler_openai_smoke.rs` is an `#[ignore]` smoke test against real OpenAI that catches schema drift before deploy.

### Known follow-ups

Three hardcoded lists remain pending a column-semantic ontology in Arango: `table_row_answer.rs::HEADER_MARKERS` (13 column-name → alias pairs), `document_target.rs::DOCUMENT_LABEL_KEYWORD_MARKERS` + `DOCUMENT_LABEL_ACRONYMS` (focused-document scoring), and `question_intent.rs::INTENT_TABLE` (classify_question_intents). `technical_literal_focus.rs::LEGACY_IGNORED_KEYWORDS` is fallback-only when the IR has no literal_constraints. These move out in the next consumer-migration PR once the ontology tables land; they do not block the verification fix.

### Snapshot scope expansion

- `GET /v1/content/libraries/{id}/snapshot?include=workspace` now packs `catalog_workspace`, `ai_provider_credential`, `ai_model_preset`, and `ai_binding_assignment` rows scoped to the workspace/library alongside the existing library-data and blobs scopes. Restore uses `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` on those tables so cloning a library onto a stack that already has the same AI bindings preserves the target's configuration. IAM rows (api_token / secrets / principals) stay out — they are tied to deployment-specific secrets and must be re-issued on the target stack.

### Admin & documents tables

- Fixed paginated sorting on the documents list: sortable columns now order the full result set on the backend instead of reordering only the current UI page. Added primary server sort keys for document cost, pipeline time, and finished time, and fixed cursor pagination for non-default document sorts.
- Fixed the admin pricing table to use one shared server-driven list path for search, provider filtering, sorting, and pagination. `GET /v1/ai/prices` now returns `{ items, total, limit, offset }`, and the UI sorts prices across the full paginated dataset instead of locally inside the loaded slice.
- The documents header now shows the library-wide total cost from the primary billing summary instead of summing only the currently loaded page, so the number stays correct across pagination, search, and local table state.
- The admin token screen now resolves workspace and library scope names server-side and shows effective permissions directly in the list and detail panel. Long raw `workspace:<uuid>` / `library:<uuid>` strings were removed from the primary UX path.

### MCP–UI Parity: `grounded_answer` tool

The IronRAG UI assistant is the reference implementation of grounded Q&A. Every MCP agent plugged into the same library now receives the same answer quality, evidence references, and guard-rails — MCP is no longer a degraded lane, it is the same pipeline exposed as a first-class tool.

- New MCP tool `**grounded_answer`** (`apps/api/src/interfaces/http/mcp/tools/grounded.rs`). Input: `library`, `query`, optional `conversationTurns`, optional `topK`, `includeDebug`. Handler is a thin translator — it creates an ephemeral conversation and delegates to the query service `execute_turn` entry point on application state, i.e. the same entry point the UI handler `POST /v1/query/sessions/{id}/turns` uses. No parallel retrieval, ranking, or answer-generation logic is introduced.
- Structured output surfaces `executionDetail`, the same assistant DTO the UI consumes, including chunk, prepared-segment, technical-fact, graph-entity, graph-relation, verifier, runtime, request, and response fields. Agents receive exactly the data the UI debug panel shows for the equivalent turn, plus top-level `runtimeExecutionId`, `executionId`, and `conversationId` shortcuts for trace lookup.
- Tool is gated by the `query_run` grant — identical to the UI path. An MCP token that can ask questions in UI can ask them over MCP; a scope denied in UI is denied in MCP. Parity is observable at the grant level, not just at the code level.
- MCP tool registry in `apps/api/src/interfaces/http/mcp.rs` extended; `visible_tool_names` advertises `grounded_answer` when the token has `query_run` somewhere.
- Docs updated (`docs/ru/MCP.md`, `docs/en/MCP.md`) — `grounded_answer` is now the top-of-list tool, with explicit guidance "prefer this over `search_documents` + `read_document` for knowledge questions". Admin UI (`apps/web/src/components/admin/McpTab.tsx`) shows an MCP–UI parity disclosure card and updates the recommended system-prompt description so every external client (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Codex, OpenClaw, VS Code) is told to call `grounded_answer` first.

### MCP Streamable HTTP transport (spec 2025-06-18)

- The `/v1/mcp` endpoint now implements the current MCP Streamable HTTP transport and nothing else — no legacy HTTP+SSE split, no parallel POST-only alias, no ad-hoc JSON-RPC surface. One URL handles the full client lifecycle:
  - `POST /v1/mcp` carries JSON-RPC requests, notifications, and batches. Content is negotiated from the `Accept` header: `application/json` → single JSON body (default, curl-friendly); `text/event-stream` (optionally alongside JSON) → one-shot SSE frame `event: message\ndata: …\n\n` so SDK clients that advertise both formats get the transport they expect. Notification-only requests (no `id`) are acknowledged with a bare `202 Accepted`.
  - `GET /v1/mcp` returns a well-formed but silent SSE stream (`200 OK`, `Content-Type: text/event-stream`, one `: ready` comment, connection idle). Spec 2025-06-18 permits either a 405 or a zero-event SSE stream; we choose the latter because some bundled MCP clients (notably OpenClaw's `bundle-mcp`, which spawns a fresh subprocess per chat session) treat any non-200 handshake as fatal and drop the whole MCP server for that agent context. A valid empty stream satisfies them without introducing real event traffic.
  - `DELETE /v1/mcp` returns `200 OK`. The server is stateless between requests — session termination is a no-op — but cleanup flows in SDK clients succeed instead of erroring.
- The `initialize` response now includes a freshly minted `Mcp-Session-Id` header (UUIDv7). Clients that pin the session via this header on subsequent calls are accepted without additional validation; the server does not correlate calls across the id because no state depends on it, but the header satisfies every compliant client (Claude Code remote, Cursor, OpenAI Responses API tools, the official `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, OpenClaw bundle-mcp).
- Protocol version is `2025-06-18`. An optional `Mcp-Protocol-Version` request header is tolerated but not required — the server advertises its version via the `initialize` response payload.
- `GET /v1/mcp` and `DELETE /v1/mcp` no longer run the Bearer-auth extractor; both answer with their unauthenticated handshake responses immediately. Bundled MCP clients (notably OpenClaw's `bundle-mcp`, spawned fresh per chat session) speculatively open the SSE stream before carrying the session Bearer, and the earlier 401 response made them drop the whole MCP server registration — group-chat agents were left without tools even though direct-message agents worked. Spec 2025-06-18 allows answering without auth on these methods.
- Smoke-tested end-to-end from the compose stack and from production with OpenClaw on a group chat: `application/json` returns `content-type: application/json` + valid JSON-RPC; `application/json, text/event-stream` returns `content-type: text/event-stream` with one `event: message` frame; `GET` returns 200 + silent SSE handshake (`: ready`); `DELETE` returns 200. Group-chat MCP tool calls now work identically to direct-message ones.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-04-16

Large-library performance release. On a 4900-document reference library the documents page drops from 26 MB / 1.2 s to 3 KB gzip / 50 ms per page, graph from 60 MB / 1.7 s to 2 MB zstd / 60 ms on Redis hit, `get_library_summary` from a broken 11 s to a correct 1.3 s, and batch rerun moves from a 5 s sync handler that timed out beyond a hundred docs to an async job with polling.

### AI catalog & admin UX

- AI model compatibility is now classified uniformly across OpenAI, Qwen, DeepSeek, and Ollama from one binding-purpose model. Hosted DeepSeek remains text-only; multimodal and embedding roles are exposed only where the provider or discovered model family actually supports them.
- `GET /v1/ai/models` no longer performs live provider `/models` discovery on every admin-page load. Generic reads now resolve against the persisted catalog plus visible credentials, while provider discovery sync runs on credential save and on narrow credential-specific refreshes only. In local profiling the AI admin read path dropped from multi-second stalls to low-millisecond responses.
- The Admin `AI` tab was redesigned for high-cardinality catalogs: scope cards, provider inventory, binding cards, searchable credentials and presets, and lazy Ollama model checks in the editor. Fixed the library-override crash caused by the missing `selectedCredentialModelSet` binding state.

### Document operations & ingest hardening

- `GET /v1/content/documents` now honors the documents UI's largest page size: the hard clamp moved from 200 to 1000 rows so bulk-selection and batch actions no longer silently operate on only the first 200 matches of a filtered result set.
- The documents surface now supports true "select all matching" expansion across paginated filtered results, keeps failed uploads visible after a batch completes, and avoids clearing operator-visible per-file errors immediately after acceptance.
- Upload MIME admission is now sniffing-first for unknown text filenames: generic binary MIME plus unknown suffixes like `.env.backup.20260116-162838` are accepted when the payload is clearly text, while explicitly unsupported declared formats such as `video/mp4` still fail fast.

### Documents list

- `GET /v1/content/documents` is now keyset-paginated: `cursor`, `limit` (50/200), `search` (ILIKE), `sortBy`, `sortOrder`, opt-in `includeTotal`. Response is a slim `ContentDocumentListItem` with server-derived `status` and `readiness`; heavy fields moved to the per-document detail endpoint used by the inspector.
- Backend list path is a single Postgres CTE with LATERAL joins replacing the previous 6-call batch prefetch. The `(library_id, created_at DESC, id DESC)` keyset index and a GIN trigram index for `search` over `lower(external_key)` are part of the baseline `0001_init.sql` migration.
- `get_library_summary` now uses a single aggregate SQL (`aggregate_library_document_readiness`) instead of iterating the document list. Fixed a Cartesian `LEFT JOIN ingest_job` that was inflating counts ~4000× during integration.
- Frontend `DocumentsPage` rewritten around server pagination + `IntersectionObserver` infinite scroll. Debounced server search and sort. Client-side status/readiness filters and local `slice()` paging removed — no mixed client/server filtering.

### Graph topology

- New `GET /v1/knowledge/libraries/{id}/graph` replaces `/graph-topology`. Wire format is compact NDJSON: sections `meta → id_map → docs → nodes → edges → doc_links → end`, UUIDs emitted once through a `u32` id map, nodes use short field keys, edges are 4-tuples `[from, to, rel, support]`. Fields the frontend never reads (`metadata_json`, workspace/library/timestamp columns, `normalized_assertion`, …) are stripped from the wire. No truncation — the full graph is always delivered.
- Redis cache by `graph:{library_id}:v{projection_version}` with a 24 h TTL, invalidated from every `upsert_runtime_graph_snapshot` call site in `projection.rs` and `rebuild.rs`.
- Frontend `getGraphTopologyStream` parses the NDJSON through a `ReadableStream` and surfaces `onProgress` to `GraphPage` for a live loading indicator.

### Observability

- `/metrics` Prometheus endpoint via `axum-prometheus` (`axum_http_requests_total`, `axum_http_requests_duration_seconds` labelled by `method`, `endpoint`, `status`). Published on `127.0.0.1:9464` in the local dev compose; in prod compose it stays off the host and is scraped via `docker exec`.
- `#[tracing::instrument]` on the hot paths: `list_documents`, `prefetch_document_summary_data`, `get_graph_topology`, the runtime-graph repository functions, `batch_reprocess_documents`, `reprocess_single_document`. Spans carry `library_id`, relevant counts, and `elapsed_ms`.

### Worker — heartbeat starvation fix

- Root cause of the repeated `lease_expired / stale_heartbeat` failures: synchronous full-library and targeted graph projection paths in the `projection` module, and the per-chunk `serde_json::from_value::<GraphExtractionCandidateSet>` inside `rebuild.rs`'s `buffer_unordered(8)` were fully synchronous CPU-bound paths on tokio worker threads with no yield points. They pegged every tokio worker at 100 %, starving the heartbeat task so leases expired while the worker was still alive.
- Fix: those CPU hot spots now run inside `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`. The heartbeat task moved onto a dedicated `heartbeat_postgres: PgPool` (`min_connections=1`, `max_connections=2`) so the main pool can be fully checked out without blocking heartbeats. New stage-level timeout `IRONRAG_RUNTIME_GRAPH_EXTRACT_STAGE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default 600) wraps `materialize_revision_graph_candidates` + `reconcile_revision_graph` via `tokio::time::timeout`, surfacing `stage_timeout` failures through the existing "degraded to readable" branch instead of silently holding a lease.

### Batch rerun — async job with polling

- `POST /v1/content/documents/batch-reprocess` now returns `202 Accepted` with `{ batchOperationId, total, libraryId, workspaceId }`. A spawned task admits the child mutations via `buffer_unordered(N)` (default 4, `IRONRAG_BATCH_REPROCESS_PARALLELISM`) bounded by `IRONRAG_BATCH_REPROCESS_TIMEOUT_SECS` (default 3600). Library consistency is enforced up front — every `documentId` must belong to the same library.
- `ops_async_operation` carries a nullable `parent_async_operation_id` FK directly in the baseline `0001_init.sql` migration. This is the single-table batch-ops mechanism — any future batch endpoint reuses the same parent/child shape.
- `GET /v1/ops/operations/{id}` returns the parent row plus `progress { total, completed, failed, inFlight }` via a single `LEFT JOIN` + FILTER aggregate. For any parent with children, `status` and `completedAt` are derived on read from progress counts (`processing` while any child pending, `failed` on any child failure, else `ready`) — no race between the spawned admit phase and child lifecycle.
- Old `BATCH_MAX_DOCUMENTS = 1000` cap replaced by a DoS sanity cap of 100 000 ids.
- Frontend shows a progress banner that polls `opsApi.getAsyncOperation(id)` with 1.5 s → 5 s adaptive backoff, refreshes the document list on terminal states, and auto-dismisses 4 s after completion.

### Library backup / restore (tar.zst)

- **Format redesign: NDJSON → tar.zst.** The old NDJSON stream truncated in browsers because the frontend buffered the entire response via `fetch().blob()`. The new format is a streaming tar archive compressed with zstd level 3 (~13× on NDJSON text). Archive layout: `manifest.json` → chunked NDJSON per table/collection (64 MiB soft cap per part) → raw blob entries → `summary.json`. `tokio-tar` + `async-compression` write into a `tokio::io::duplex` pair piped into `Body::from_stream` with natural back-pressure.
- **Streaming Arango cursor.** New `ArangoClient::query_json_batches` yields cursor batches via an async callback instead of merging the entire result into memory. The old path OOM-killed the backend on `knowledge_structured_block` (545 k rows / ~1 GB JSON). Export now streams through a bounded `mpsc` channel (depth 2) between the cursor producer task and the tar writer.
- **Edge `library_id` propagation.** Every Arango edge insert now carries `library_id` (10 wrapper methods, 12 call sites, 8 files). Persistent indexes on `library_id` for all 15 edge collections. Snapshot export edge query uses `FILTER edge.library_id == @lid` instead of the old per-edge `DOCUMENT()` lookup — edge export stage dropped from **11.3 s → <2 ms** on the large-library reference fixture.
- **Batched import.** `PgBatcher` flushes every 1 000 rows via `jsonb_populate_recordset`; `ArangoBatcher` flushes via `FOR doc IN @docs INSERT`. Large-library full restore (107 k pg + 466 k arango rows) dropped from **>5 min (nginx 504)** to **~78 s**.
- **Bulk Arango timeout.** `query_json_bulk` and `query_json_batches` carry a 10-minute per-request timeout override. The default 15 s Arango client timeout was truncating edge cleanup and large-batch inserts.
- **Replace mode.** `POST /snapshot?overwrite=replace` clears the library footprint (reverse-FK Postgres delete, Arango edge/doc purge, blob stash) before restoring. Import trusts the archive manifest for include kinds — no duplicate selector on the request.
- **Simplified include scope.** `IncludeKind` collapsed from `content / runtime_graph / knowledge / blobs` to `**library_data` + `blobs`**. A library is one atomic domain unit; the old split leaked storage tiers into the UI. Back-compat shim maps old tokens to `library_data`. UI dialog: one always-on "Library data" card + one "Include source files" checkbox.
- Export throughput on the large-library reference fixture (24 k nodes, 82 k edges, 445 k structured blocks): **6.1 s / 42 MiB** (was 17.4 s before edge indexes, truncated before tar.zst).

### Graph rendering performance

- **Web Worker layout offload.** `applyGraphLayout` runs in a dedicated module worker (`graphLayout.worker.ts`, ~~70 KB chunk) for graphs ≥ 3 000 nodes. The main thread builds Graphology + inits Sigma while the worker computes coordinates off-thread; positions are returned via a `Float32Array` transferable buffer (zero-copy). Large-library first canvas paint: **~~1.6 s** (was browser "page is slowing down" warning).
- **Hidden-edge precompute.** The `hiddenIds → hiddenEdgeIds` derivation moved from the per-hover reducer effect (O(M) on every hover commit) to a dedicated effect keyed only on `hiddenIds` change. Hover branches read a pre-built `Set<edgeId>` ref — O(1) per edge per frame.
- **O(degree) selection.** Click-mode connected-edge lookup uses `graph.edges(selectedId)` (O(degree)) instead of `graph.forEachEdge` (O(M)). On the large-library reference fixture: ~8 edges vs 82 k scan per click.
- **Instant layout at density.** Layout transitions skip the 280 ms per-frame interpolation at ≥ 5 000 nodes — the animation burned 1.5 M `setNodeAttribute` calls/sec with no visual value at that density.
- **Labels disabled at extreme density.** `renderLabels: false` at > 15 000 nodes eliminates Sigma's label collision pass (the dominant per-frame cost). `selectProminentGraphLabelIds` O(N log N) sort also skipped in that regime.
- **Byte-buffered NDJSON parser.** `getGraphTopologyStream` uses a `Uint8Array` ring buffer with direct 0x0A scan instead of the old `pending += chunk; pending.slice()` pattern, preventing O(N²) string churn at 100 k+ node topologies.

### MCP performance

- **N+1 eliminated from capability snapshot.** `visible_workspaces` used to loop N workspaces issuing one `load_visible_library_contexts` per workspace. New `visible_catalog` loads workspaces + all libraries in 2 concurrent queries via `tokio::try_join!` and groups in memory. `mcp.capabilities`: 132 ms → **50 ms**; `mcp.initialize`: 116 ms → **53 ms**.

### Release-readiness tooling

- `**scripts/ops/release-check.py`** — consolidated pre-release smoke + perf suite. 24 checks covering auth, catalog, content, knowledge, snapshot export, and MCP tools. Per-check latency budgets with pass/warn/fail verdicts, top-10 latency table, machine-readable JSON output. Replaces ad-hoc curl scripts.

### Extraction pipeline refactor

- **tree-sitter AST extraction for 15 languages.** Code identifier extraction switched from substring heuristics (`"fn "`, `"class "`, `"const "`) to real AST parsing via tree-sitter. Supported: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Bash, Rust, Go, Java, C, C#, Ruby, PHP, Swift, Scala, YAML, Proto. Each grammar tested with per-language unit tests. Heuristic fallbacks removed entirely — if tree-sitter doesn't support the language, no code identifier fact is produced.
- **Structural config parsing (JSON, YAML, TOML).** Config key extraction via `serde_json`, `serde_yaml`, `toml_edit` replaces the old `split_once(':')` / `split_once('=')` heuristic that produced false positives on prose. Only declared config-language blocks are parsed.
- **URL and version parsing via real crates.** `url::Url::parse` (RFC 3986) replaces `starts_with("http://")`. `semver::Version::parse` replaces manual digit splitting.
- **Block-family dispatch.** The extraction loop dispatches extractors by block kind instead of running all 14 on every line. CodeBlock → identifiers + env vars + config keys; EndpointBlock → full HTTP surface; Table → endpoints + config + params; Prose → URLs + versions + error codes.
- **Parser-derived confidence.** Confidence now derived from the parser that produced the fact (AST node → 0.98, structural parse → 0.97, keyword heuristic → 0.94) instead of hardcoded values per block kind.
- **Typed QuestionIntent.** `QuestionIntent` enum with 10 intents (Endpoint, Parameter, HttpMethod, Version, ErrorCode, EnvVar, ConfigKey, Protocol, BasePrefix, Port) and a structured bilingual keyword table. Replaces scattered `contains()` chains across 4 files.
- **Fact-grounded deterministic answers.** Endpoint and parameter answers now require matching technical facts in the evidence store, not substring parsing of chunk text.
- **Branded identifier heuristics removed.** Heading phrase matching and catalog link guessing deleted from the pipeline — entity extraction is the LLM's job, not the fact store's.

### Token scopes & MCP

- **System-scope tokens.** New scope level for tokens with no workspace restriction — full admin across all workspaces. UI scope selector: System / Workspace / Library.
- **Auto-inference of workspace_id / library_id.** MCP tools and the query API auto-fill IDs from the token scope when exactly one workspace or library is accessible. `list_documents.libraryId` is now optional; query session `workspaceId` is optional.
- **Leaner MCP initialize response.** Removed `tokenId`, `tools` list (duplicate of tools/list), `generatedAt` from the initialize JSON-RPC response. 833 → 270 chars.
- **Permission hierarchy in token mint UI.** Grouped cards (Admin, Workspace, Library & Content, Operations) with lucide icons and human-readable labels. Implied permissions show as checked+disabled. `connector_admin` added. Labels explicitly mention import/export capabilities.

### Query execution performance

- **O(1) edge lookup.** `QueryGraphIndex.edges` switched from `Vec` with linear `.find()` to `HashMap<Uuid, GraphViewEdgeWrite>`. On the large-library reference fixture (82 k edges), `map_edge_hit` dropped from ~41 M comparisons to ~500 hash lookups per query.
- **Batched extract candidate inserts.** `replace_extract_node_candidates` and `replace_extract_edge_candidates` switched from per-row INSERT to `QueryBuilder::push_values()` bulk INSERT … RETURNING. On a 5 k-doc library with ~50 candidates per chunk, this eliminates millions of sequential round-trips during ingest.
- **Batched audit subject inserts.** `append_audit_event` subject loop switched to single-statement `push_values` INSERT.
- **Extract candidate indexes.** New migration `0003_extract_candidate_indexes.sql` adds `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` on `extract_node_candidate(chunk_result_id)` and `extract_edge_candidate(chunk_result_id)` — the tables lacked FK indexes and every per-chunk DELETE/SELECT was a full table scan.

### AI catalog bootstrap

- **Pre-seeded model presets for all providers.** `seed_all_provider_presets` runs at bootstrap and creates presets for OpenAI, DeepSeek, Qwen, and Ollama (4 purposes × 4 providers = 16 presets) regardless of whether API keys are configured. Operators can immediately assign bindings after adding a credential — no manual preset creation required.
- **Preset lookup fix.** `select_runtime_preset` no longer falls back to a single-model match when the expected preset name doesn't match. The old behavior returned the wrong preset when two purposes (e.g. ExtractGraph + QueryAnswer) shared the same model (qwen3:0.6b), preventing the second preset from being created.

### Code quality

- **Named constants for vector kinds.** `VECTOR_KIND_CHUNK` / `VECTOR_KIND_ENTITY` (8 sites). `FACT_FETCH_MULTIPLIER` / `FACT_FETCH_MIN`. Domain status constants `ASYNC_OP_STATUS_*`, `MUTATION_KIND_*`, `GRAPH_STATUS_*` (15+ sites).
- `**execution_id_of()` helper.** Deduplicates 5-site `.expect(...)` pattern.
- **ServiceRole enum dispatch.** Config string matching replaced with existing `ServiceRole::Api/Worker/Startup` enum.
- **N+1 query eliminated in document lifecycle.** Batch `list_ingest_attempts_by_jobs` / `list_ingest_stage_events_by_jobs` via `WHERE job_id = ANY($1)` — 2 queries regardless of job count.
- **Sequential awaits → `tokio::try_join!`** in AI catalog service.
- **Dead code removal.** Query execution scaffolding, branded identifier heuristics, unused types.
- **In-place dedup.** BTreeSet roundtrip pattern (4 sites) → `sort_unstable() + dedup()`.
- **MCP library_ids capped** at 50 per request.

### Platform bits

- `tower-http::compression` layer (gzip + br + zstd) added globally.
- `nginx.conf.template`: `proxy_buffering off` and `proxy_request_buffering off`.
- New deps: `tokio-tar`, `async-compression`, `tokio-util`, `tree-sitter` 0.25 + 15 grammar crates, `serde_yaml`, `toml_edit`.
- All backend + frontend deps updated to latest compatible versions.

## 0.2.3 — 2026-04-14

### Diff-aware reuse correctness & graph fail-fast

- **Diff-reuse no longer poisons the new revision's lifecycle**. `materialize_revision_graph_candidates` synthesizes a `runtime_graph_extraction` record for every chunk whose text checksum matches the parent revision, but used to clone `raw_output_json` verbatim — including the parent revision's `lifecycle.revision_id`. The downstream `reconcile_revision_graph` filter then dropped every reused record because `extraction_lifecycle.revision_id != Some(current_revision_id)`, leaving the merge with **0 records → 0 nodes → 0 edges** even though all 100 chunks looked "ready" in the table. Fix: rewrite `raw_output_json.lifecycle.revision_id` to the current revision before persisting the synthetic record. Triggered for any retry/edit on a CSV-style document where every row is structurally identical.
- **Fail-fast graph pipeline**. `run_inline_post_chunk_pipeline` used to swallow a "0 contributions" reconcile by recording `extract_graph` as `completed` with `graphReady=false` and degrading to `graph_state='processing'`, leaving the document permanently stuck in a misleading half-state with no error visible. The pipeline now returns `ApiError` whenever `materialize` errors, `reconcile` errors, or `graph_ready` is false; the ingest job is marked `failed` and the revision's `graph_state='failed'`. Single unified path — no `degradedToReadable` shim.
- **Honest stage timings**. The "embed_chunk" stage used to fire a fake "deferred" `started`/`completed` pair before `materialize` even ran, then re-emit `completed` after reconcile finished, which made `merge_stages` report the full wall clock (~19.6 s) for both `Extract Graph` AND `Embed Chunk`. The pipeline now uses two independent timers: `extract_elapsed_ms` covers only the LLM materialization phase, `embed_elapsed_ms` covers only the reconcile phase, and the `embed_chunk` stage event is emitted **only** when `embedding_usage` is actually present (no no-op fallback row).
- **Single source of truth for `Extract Graph` model name**. `materialize_revision_graph_candidates` now reads `provider_kind` and `model_name` directly from the active extract-graph binding (`graph_runtime_context.provider_profile.indexing`), so the pipeline event always carries the binding model — even when 100 % of chunks are reused and the per-chunk LLM call never ran. Removed the `provider_kind` / `model_name` fields from `ChunkExtractAggregate` since they were dead code under the new scheme.

### Document status priority chain

- **In-flight job beats stale readiness**. Both `interfaces/http/ops.rs::map_document_status` and `apps/web/src/pages/documents/mappers.ts::mapApiDocument` checked `readiness_is_ready` before checking `queue_state`, so a document with previous successful readiness and a freshly enqueued retry job stayed visually "Ready" until the retry actually finished — operators couldn't tell if their click had registered. The priority chain is now: terminal failure → `canceled`/`failed` → `leased` (Processing/Blocked/Retrying/Stalled) → `queued` → `graph_ready`/`readable` → `graph_sparse` → zombie `completed`. Backend and frontend mappers stay symmetric.

### Documents page live updates

- **Quiet 5-second background refresh**. The documents page used to poll only when at least one document was in `processing` state, on a 15-second interval, and replaced the entire `documents` array on each tick — which left selected-row inspector data stale until the user clicked the row again. Polling now runs unconditionally on a 5-second cadence whenever the page is mounted, refreshes both the table rows and the selected document's full inspector payload (lifecycle, segments, facts) in place, and never resets row selection or any inspector sub-state. `silent=true` keeps the spinner and error banner out of the polling path.

### Ingest throughput & worker stability

- **Parallel per-chunk graph merge**. `reconcile_revision_graph` used to walk `latest_records_by_chunk` sequentially, paying ~130 sequential DB round-trips per chunk × N chunks per doc — pinning all 4 tokio runtime worker threads at 100 % CPU and starving the heartbeat / dispatcher / cancel-poll tasks. Wrapped the chunk loop in `stream::iter().buffer_unordered(8)` with `Arc`-shared pool / quality_guard / document / merge_scope captures, and consume `latest_records_by_chunk.into_values()` so `record.normalized_output_json` is `mem::take`'d straight into the deserializer (no per-chunk deep clone of `serde_json::Value`). Empirically reproduced on prod data: worker CPU dropped from **502 % → 7 %** (62× less starvation), tokio threads moved from `state=R` (running) to `state=S` (sleeping on futex), pipeline throughput unblocked.
- **Bulk `runtime_graph_evidence` insert**. New `bulk_create_runtime_graph_evidence_for_chunk` repository function batches every per-chunk evidence row (typically 50+ for 10 entities + 10 relations) into a single `INSERT ... SELECT FROM unnest(...)` round-trip. `merge_chunk_graph_candidates` collects `GraphEvidenceTarget`s into a `Vec` during the per-entity / per-relation walk and flushes once at the end. Replaces ~50 sequential single-row INSERTs per chunk with one bulk insert.
- **TLS `close_notify` retry coverage**. The transport retry classifier was missing the rustls "peer dropped TLS session mid-response" pattern. Production worker would see `error decoding response body: ... peer closed connection without sending TLS close_notify` from the LLM provider, fail to recognize it as retryable, and surface `extract_graph` as failed after ~51 s at the outer recovery layer. Added `peer closed connection` and `close_notify` to `is_retryable_transport_error_text` so these cases now go through the standard `[1, 3, 10, 30, 90]` s schedule.

### Dashboard / documents page consolidation

- **Single source of truth for "Failed" counts**. The dashboard `failed_documents` and the documents-page filter pill used different mappers and disagreed by an order of magnitude (dashboard reported 142 failed, the documents page reported 4829 for the same library). The backend `map_document_status` in `interfaces/http/ops.rs` now mirrors the frontend `mapApiDocument` rules: `queue_state='canceled'` and zombie completions (`queue_state='completed'` with no readable / sparse readiness) both map to `DocumentStatus::Failed`, matching the frontend bucket. Both surfaces now report the same count.
- **Empty graph view fix**. `get_graph_workbench` and the graph topology endpoint relied on `runtime_graph_state` to derive an entity's `entity_state`, but the function read `metadata.extraction_recovery_status` first — which contains values like `clean`, `recovered`, `partial` describing how the node was extracted, **not** whether it is admitted. With "active" hard-coded as the filter target, ~99 % of nodes were dropped: a large library's graph displayed as "0 nodes / Graph is empty". Fixed by removing `extraction_recovery_status` from the state derivation chain — entity_state now resolves from `metadata.entity_state` / `metadata.relation_state` and falls back to `"active"`.

### Graph viewer interactivity (frontend)

- **Edges no longer disappear during pan/zoom** — `hideEdgesOnMove: false`. The previous `hideEdgesOnMove: denseGraph` made the graph feel broken on every cursor move.
- **Hover ≠ click**. Hover used to dim every other node and re-color edges; now hover only highlights the node + neighbors, and edges are never touched. Click owns the focus mode (selected node + neighbors keep color, every other node fades to white, only edges incident to the selection light up).
- **Dwell-time hover (140 ms)**. Hover state commits only after the cursor pauses on a node — fast sweeps across a dense graph never trigger the expensive `sigma.refresh()` (~120 ms on 25 k nodes). The dwell gate keeps `HOVER_FPS` at the 60 fps baseline during sweeps.
- **DOM tooltip card anchored to node viewport**. Hover shows a floating card with the full node label, neighbor count, and the first 12 neighbor names. The card is positioned via `sigma.graphToViewport(node.x, node.y)` and re-anchored on every camera `updated` event, so it stays glued to the node during pan/zoom instead of trailing the cursor.
- **Density-aware label rendering**. `labelRenderedSizeThreshold` scales 8 → 10 → 14 → 20 with `nodes.length` and `labelGridCellSize` jumps 100 → 240 on dense graphs. `hideLabelsOnMove` is now true for every graph above 5 k nodes (was 140). Hover no longer `forceLabel`-s neighbors on dense graphs.
- **Pre-computed neighbor index + label lookup**. `useMemo<Map<string, Set<string>>>` rebuilt only when `nodes` / `edges` change; hover and click both read it as O(1) instead of walking the graphology adjacency list each time.
- **Layout spacing tuned for `autoRescale`**. `layoutBands`, `layoutSectors`, `layoutRings` now spread cells aggressively (`orderRoot * 1.4` for bands, `× 4` inner radius for sectors, `× 1.6` ring gaps) so even after Sigma compresses 25 k nodes into the viewport the cells stay visually distinct.
- **Density-aware node radius**. Per-node `size` shrinks with the visible node count (3..13 → 2..7 → 1.4..4 → 1..2.6 across density tiers) so dense graphs do not paint as a solid color block.

### Local profiling environment

- Reproduced the 0.2.2 symptoms on a local stack seeded from a production pg_dump of a large reference library (~5 k docs, ~25 k graph nodes, ~80 k edges, ~230 k evidence rows). Root-cause analysis behind the 0.2.3 changes and the reproduction harness used to validate the merge-loop and viewer fixes (Playwright + Chromium hover-FPS measurement) captured in `tmp/prod-0.2.2-perf-analysis.md`.

## 0.2.2 — 2026-04-13

### Ingest resilience

- Startup lease sweep (`reclaim_orphaned_leases_on_startup`) requeues orphan `leased` rows before the dispatcher claims anything, so a backend/worker restart no longer freezes in-flight docs. Steady-state reaper tightened to 15s interval / 60s stale threshold.
- Dispatcher claim query now counts **all** `queue_state='leased'` rows against the global / workspace / library limits — the previous `heartbeat_at` freshness filter introduced a TOCTOU that let the per-library cap be bypassed, stacking parallel docs past the cgroup.
- Cancel now reaches active leases. `cancel_jobs_for_document` flips both `ingest_job → canceled` and `ingest_attempt → canceled` in one CTE; the heartbeat loop polls `queue_state` and signals a `JobCancellationToken` that pipeline stages check between steps, so a cancel is observed in ≤15 s.
- Retry unsticks stalled documents (`force_reset_inflight_for_retry`), falls back to the latest `content_revision` when the head promote never fired, and tombstones orphans with zero revisions. Web retries re-fetch the source URL via `WebIngestService::refetch_document_source`; uploaded docs reuse their stored source. Diff-aware chunk reuse is preserved across retries.

### Worker memory footprint

- Vision LLM image bytes moved instead of cloned (`describe_extracted_images` takes `Vec<ExtractedImage>` by value, drops each image after its call). `extraction_plan` is moved into the primary extracted-content aggregate instead of deep-cloned. Per-chunk graph-extract uses `Arc<…>` for shared state and `try_fold` instead of `buffer_unordered + try_collect` so nothing accumulates across a document's chunk stream.
- PDF extractor parses the `lopdf::Document` once (was twice), `drop`s it before vision phase, and caps images at 30 / 150 MB per doc. HTML extractor truncates the decoded source to 4 MB at a tag boundary before `scraper::Html::parse_document` so pathological Confluence exports can't blow the `html5ever` arena. Both paths warn but never reject a document.
- Noisy third-party `tracing` crates (`scraper`, `html5ever`, `selectors`, `hyper`, `h2`, `reqwest`, `rustls`, `sqlx`, `mio`, `tower`, `tonic`, `tungstenite`) are clamped to `warn` in `telemetry::init` regardless of `IRONRAG_LOG_FILTER`, so `debug` no longer amplifies HTML parse events into gigabytes of log allocation.
- `build_chunk_reuse_plan` stores `Arc<RuntimeGraphExtractionRecordRow>` in all three HashMaps so the diff-reuse path refcount-bumps instead of deep-cloning `raw_output_json` + `normalized_output_json` three times per doc.

### Throughput & CPU

- Per-library dispatcher ceiling raised to 16 with a **memory-aware throttle**: before each claim, `fill_available_job_slots` reads worker RSS and holds new claims when the process is over `ingestion_memory_soft_limit_mib`. The soft limit auto-resolves to 90 % of the detected cgroup (or `/proc/meminfo`) memory — any container size gets a sensible cap with zero manual tuning; an explicit positive value overrides.
- Per-document graph-extract fan-out decoupled from the cross-doc limit via the new `ingestion_graph_extract_parallelism_per_doc` (default 8). Heavy docs get proper chunk parallelism without raising `per_library`.
- LLM transport retries now follow a fixed `[1, 3, 10, 30, 90]` second schedule (5 retries, 134 s total) covering timeouts and the retryable 4xx/5xx set (408, 409, 425, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504, 520–524, 529). `llm_transport_retry_attempts` bumped 3 → 5 and `runtime_graph_extract_recovery_max_attempts` 2 → 4 so both layers have room to run.
- Synchronous extractors (`extract_pdf`, `extract_docx`, `extract_tabular`, `extract_pptx`, `extract_html_main_content`) now run on `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`, freeing the async runtime for concurrent I/O. Postgres connection pool raised 20 → 64 so 16 parallel jobs don't contend on connections. Heartbeat loop now respects `ingestion_worker_heartbeat_interval_seconds` instead of using a hardcoded constant.

### Vocabulary-aware graph extraction

- New `list_observed_sub_type_hints` aggregates existing `metadata_json->>'sub_type'` values per `node_type` for the library + projection version. `build_graph_extraction_prompt_plan` renders them as a `sub_type_hints` section so the model converges on in-use vocabulary instead of inventing fresh near-duplicates.

### Document status taxonomy (UI)

- `DocumentStatus` with strict priority: `canceled` → `failed` → `ready` → `blocked` / `retrying` / `stalled` → `processing` → `queued`. Timer only ticks for in-flight states. `documentStatusSortRank` + `Finished` column give operators proper severity sort and completion time.
- Filter pills rebuilt around four buckets: **All | In Progress | Needs Attention | Ready | Failed**. Retry toasts surface real outcomes with accurate skipped / failed counts; documents that no longer exist come back as `skipped` instead of `failed`. `queue_state='completed'` + `readiness='processing'` zombies are reclassified as `failed` with an explicit reason.
- Inspector cleanup: dropped the legacy "Re-ingest from URL" button, summary truncated to 280 chars with a "Show full" toggle, `source_uri` shown for `web_page` docs instead of the `viewpage.action` basename.

### Documentation

- `docs/{en,ru}/PIPELINE.md` refreshed for the new parallelism model, memory-aware throttle, auto-resolved soft limit, LLM retry schedule, and updated lease thresholds.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-04-12

- Fixed web snapshot persistence for long percent-encoded page and attachment URLs.
- Fixed graph edge rendering during zoom and selection so focused neighbors stay visible above unrelated nodes.
- Fixed web-ingested documents to render as `Web page` instead of leaking raw source/file extensions into the type column.
- Added standard token minting for an explicit target workspace plus multi-library grants in one token, fixed library-scoped discovery so tokens only enumerate selected libraries, and closed the workspace-scoped `iam_admin` auth bypass.
- Hid unfinished connector-admin permissions from user-facing token issuance surfaces while keeping connector support on the backend roadmap.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-04-12

### Highlights

- Rebranded the shipped product from `RustRAG` to `IronRAG` across env vars, packages, images, charts, OpenAPI, and release-facing docs.
- Added a full-screen document editor for text, `docx`, and `xlsx` uploads with table-aware markdown editing and automatic reprocessing after save.
- Unified `xlsx`, `docx`, `pdf`, and `csv` table handling on one shared extraction path with grounded row and column-summary semantics.
- Added a full document lifecycle inspector with per-stage duration, model/provider identity, token usage, and cost from the primary billing path.
- Rebuilt the in-app assistant on one unified MCP-tool agent loop and added a DeepSeek bootstrap preset for first-run provider setup.
- Added diff-aware ingest reuse so unchanged chunks can skip repeated graph extraction on document replacement and edit flows.

### Breaking Changes

- **Schema reset**: the database baseline was consolidated to one `0001_init.sql` migration; legacy execution and accounting paths were removed.
- **Assistant/MCP cutover**: the standalone `ask` shortcut and parallel special-case assistant flow were removed; assistant Q&A now runs only through the unified MCP tool loop.
- **IRONRAG rename**: release-facing configuration now uses `IRONRAG`** naming instead of `RUSTRAG`**.

### Platform

- Billing and pipeline cost rollups now come from one primary source of truth, including vision and embedding calls.
- System-level IAM grants now authorize correctly across workspaces, libraries, and documents.
- Document delete and revision-head writes were hardened so primary Postgres state can commit cleanly even when read-model cleanup degrades to warnings.
- Grounding guardrails now refuse conflicting or insufficiently supported answers instead of shipping hallucinated output.
- Added `ironrag-cli` for users, tokens, workspaces, libraries, and scoped permission management.
- Deployment surfaces were aligned around the split `web` / `api` / `worker` / `startup` topology for Docker and Helm.

### Refactor

- Split major backend hotspots into focused graph-store, MCP, AI catalog, ingest, graph-service, and query submodules while deleting legacy release artifacts and dead code.
- Trimmed the MCP protocol to the declared tool surface only: no fake resources capability, no legacy aliases, and permission-filtered `tools/list`.
- Removed silent error swallowing and cleaned up the release line to a zero-warning backend build.

### Validation

- Added release-gate coverage for end-to-end pipeline quality and graph mutation correctness.
- Revalidated the Docker and Helm deployment paths for the `0.2.0` release line.

## 0.1.3 — 2026-04-10

### Performance — Ingestion Parallelism

- **Parallel embedding batches** (`ingest/runtime.rs`): node and edge embedding now sends batches in parallel via `futures::stream::buffer_unordered`. New env var `IRONRAG_INGESTION_EMBEDDING_PARALLELISM=4` (default) controls how many embed batches run concurrently per job. For a 200-chunk document this is ~4x faster end-to-end.
- **Per-library job isolation** (`ingest_repository::claim_next_queued_ingest_job`): SQL claim now optionally caps the number of `leased` jobs per library. New env var `IRONRAG_INGESTION_MAX_JOBS_PER_LIBRARY=0` (0 = unlimited) prevents one busy library from starving others when many docs are queued at once.
- **Parallel web crawl fetches** (`ingest/web::discover_recursive_scope`): the BFS frontier is now drained in waves of N candidates and HTTP fetches run in parallel via `buffer_unordered`, while DB writes stay sequential per result for stable seen-set determinism. New env var `IRONRAG_WEB_INGEST_CRAWL_CONCURRENCY=4`.
- All three knobs are independent and tunable per deployment via env vars. Defaults are conservative (4) and tested against the local stack.

### Refactor — Bootstrap Flow Cleanup

- **Removed legacy `/iam/bootstrap/claim` endpoint** entirely: route, handler, `BootstrapClaimRequest/Response`, `BootstrapClaimCommand/Outcome`, service method, OpenAPI paths and schemas, integration test, and the `bootstrap_token` / `bootstrap_claim_enabled` config fields with their `IRONRAG_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` env var. Single bootstrap surface is now `/iam/bootstrap/setup` only.
- **Display name optional** in bootstrap setup: backend already accepted `Option<String>` and falls back to login; frontend no longer validates it as required and passes `undefined` when empty.
- **Required field markers** in `LoginPage`: red `*` next to required labels (Admin login, Password) plus `(optional)` hint next to Display name; matching `login.optional` i18n key in en/ru locales.
- **Cursor pointer everywhere**: added `cursor: pointer` to all `button:not(:disabled)`, `[role="button"]`, `a[href]`, `label[for]`, `summary`, `select` via `@layer base` global rule in `index.css`, plus baked into the `Button` cva so the shadcn variant gets it explicitly. Disabled controls get `cursor: not-allowed`.

### Refactor — Code Quality + Hierarchy

- `**shared/` restructure**: 7 files moved into `shared/extraction/` (chunking, file_extract, structured_document, text_render, technical_facts) and `shared/web/` (ingest, url_identity). Root keeps only core shared primitives.
- `**services/` restructure**: 43 flat files reorganized into 8 domain folders — `graph/`, `query/`, `content/`, `ingest/`, `mcp/`, `ops/`, `iam/`, `knowledge/`. ~80 import sites updated.
- `**query/execution.rs` split started**: 7909-line megafile reduced to 6346 in `mod.rs` plus 5 extracted submodules — `embed`, `hyde_crag`, `technical_literals`, `verification`, `port_answer` (-20%, 1631 lines moved out).
- *Dead `legacy`_ bootstrap flags removed**: `legacy_ui_bootstrap_enabled`, `legacy_bootstrap_token_endpoint_enabled`, `allow_legacy_startup_side_effects` deleted from config and 5 integration tests. `legacy_ui_bootstrap_admin` renamed to `ui_bootstrap_admin`.
- **Silent error swallowing fixed**: 14 `let _ = state...` audit/append sites converted to explicit `if let Err(e) = ... { warn!(stage=..., error=%e, ...); }` with structured logging. 31 cosmetic `let _ = HashSet::insert()` cleaned up.
- **Frontend `any` elimination**: 52 `any` removed from `pages/{Documents,Graph,Assistant,Admin}.tsx`, all `apiFetch<any>` calls in `api/*.ts` typed against `Raw`* interfaces, `ApiError.body` typed as `ApiErrorBody`. Added 11 new typed interfaces.
- **Observability**: HyDE/CRAG/multimodal extraction stages emit structured `stage=` tracing per the constitution severity convention.
- **Backend test debt cleanup**: split `content_lifecycle.rs` into a reusable `tests/support/content_lifecycle_support.rs` fixture plus a dedicated lineage test file, bringing the main lifecycle test back under the 1000-line cap; removed stale unused worker imports in web-ingest integration tests.

### Deploy

- Added the primary Helm chart for `web`, `api`, `worker`, and one `startup` job.
- Added `docker-compose-s4.yml` for the bundled stack with [s4core](https://github.com/s4core/s4core) and S3 storage.
- Kept `docker-compose.yml` as the classic bundled stack with filesystem storage.

### Changed

- Split runtime into `api`, `worker`, and `startup`.
- Moved migrations and bootstrap out of serving pods into the startup authority.
- Added the standard storage contract: `filesystem` or S3-compatible object storage.
- Added real source links for documents and grounded answers.
- Fixed replace/delete cleanup so query-chunk references from superseded or deleted revisions are removed instead of leaving stale graph/query state behind.
- Fixed deleted document detail responses to stop exposing stale readiness, prepared counts, and source download links after terminal deletion.
- Made `/v1/ready` report actual deployment, dependency, storage, and topology state.
- Fixed first-run OpenAI bootstrap validation for the current chat-completions API.
- Fixed Swagger/OpenAPI rendering by removing a duplicate YAML key and adding a duplicate-key test.
- Split the documents page into smaller modules and added a staged 1000-line file limit in pre-commit.

### Validation

- `docker compose config` for filesystem and `s4core` profiles — pass
- `helm lint` and `helm template` — pass
- live upload, query, source-download, and Swagger/OpenAPI checks on the Minikube Helm release — pass

## 0.1.2 — 2026-04-08

### Highlights

- **Sigma.js WebGL graph renderer**: replaced Canvas2D with Sigma.js for rendering 11K+ nodes and 54K+ edges via WebGL. 7 layout algorithms (cloud, circle, rings, lanes, clusters, islands, spiral), node dragging, connected-edge overlay, pointer cursor on hover.
- **Entity sub-type extraction**: LLM pipeline now extracts freeform `sub_type` for entities (e.g., person→engineer, artifact→framework). Flows through ArangoDB storage, API, and frontend legend.
- **Vertical graph legend**: left-side collapsible legend with clickable types and sub-types, counts, show-all/invert/hide controls.
- **Documents page tabs**: split into Documents and Web Ingest tabs with independent views, filter bar with status icons and counts, total cost inline.
- **Full dependency upgrade**: React 18→19, TypeScript 5→6, Vite 5→8, Tailwind CSS 3→4, Zod 3→4, ESLint 9→10, plus 50+ other packages updated.
- **Dashboard cleanup**: removed duplicated status layers, consolidated the main library overview, and made dashboard tiles actionable with direct deep-links into filtered documents and graph views.
- **Truthful operational metrics**: fixed dashboard totals and graph counters so document counts, failed counts, nodes, and edges reflect the full active library instead of truncated recent slices.
- **Admin operations clarity**: replaced raw `degraded` signaling with explicit operator guidance, recommended next actions, and direct navigation to failed documents or graph troubleshooting paths.
- **Audit usability upgrade**: added server-backed audit pagination, result/surface filters, and free-text search in the admin panel.

### Graph

- **Sigma.js WebGL renderer**: replaces Canvas2D. Handles 11K nodes / 54K edges at interactive frame rates via GPU-accelerated rendering.
- **7 layout algorithms**: cloud (force-directed jitter), circle (scaled), rings (concentric by type), lanes (horizontal rows by type), clusters (Vogel-disc per type), islands (BFS connected components), spiral (golden-angle, degree-sorted).
- **Connected-edge overlay**: selected node's edges render on a separate Canvas2D overlay on top of all other edges, with curved arrows and blue highlight.
- **Edge z-index**: `zIndex: 2` for connected edges in Sigma's edge reducer ensures visual priority.
- **Node dragging**: `downNode` + `mousemovebody` + `mouseup` events with camera lock during drag.
- **Pointer cursor**: cursor changes to pointer on node hover via `enterNode`/`leaveNode` events.
- **Vertical legend**: collapsible left-side panel with type counts, clickable sub-types, show-all/invert/hide-legend buttons.
- **Layout toolbar**: monochrome icon buttons (⬡○◎≡⬢◇✺) with active state highlight using `bg-primary`.

### Pipeline

- **Entity sub-type extraction**: added `sub_type: Option<String>` to `GraphEntityCandidate`. LLM prompt updated with sub_type in schema and few-shot examples (framework, database, microservice, http_status_code, etc.).
- **Sub-type storage**: `candidate_sub_type` / `entity_sub_type` fields added to ArangoDB entity documents. Schema-less — no migration needed, `#[serde(default)]` handles old documents.
- **Sub-type API**: `entitySubType` returned in entity list/detail HTTP responses via `metadata_json`.

### Frontend

- **Documents page tabs**: split into Documents tab (table + filters + pagination + upload) and Web Ingest tab (run list + add link). Independent views, shared inspector panel.
- **Filter bar redesign**: status filter buttons now include icons (⏱ processing, ✓ ready, ⚠ sparse, ✕ failed) and count badges. Total cost moved inline into the filter bar.
- **Web ingest status fix**: `COMPLETED_PARTIAL` now treated as terminal state, no longer triggers "in progress" banner.
- **Graph sub-type filtering**: `hiddenSubTypes` state allows hiding individual sub-types from the graph. Sub-type badges are clickable in the legend.
- **Node inspector**: shows sub-type below the primary type label with translated label.
- **i18n**: added 8 new keys (showLegend, hideLegend, showAll, invert, resetFilter, subType, tabs.documents, tabs.webIngest) in both en.json and ru.json.

### Dependencies

- **React** 18.3 → 19.2, **TypeScript** 5.8 → 6.0, **Vite** 5.4 → 8.0
- **Tailwind CSS** 3.4 → 4.2 (migrated from JS config to CSS-based `@theme`, PostCSS removed, `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin)
- **Zod** 3.25 → 4.3, **ESLint** 9.32 → 10.2, **react-router-dom** 6.30 → 7.14
- **recharts** 2.15 → 3.8, **sonner** 1.7 → 2.0, **lucide-react** 0.462 → 1.7
- **Rust**: tokio 1.51.0→1.51.1, zip 8.5.0→8.5.1 (minor patches)
- 50+ other npm packages updated to latest versions

### Backend

- Batch document endpoints, audit pagination, URL-backed document pagination.
- Dashboard totals and graph counters fixed to reflect full active library.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-04-07

### Highlights

- **Universal entity taxonomy**: 10 domain-agnostic entity types (`person`, `organization`, `location`, `event`, `artifact`, `natural`, `process`, `concept`, `attribute`, `entity`) designed to work across any domain — programming, medicine, law, finance, biology, engineering, and beyond. Domain-specific granularity via `sub_type` metadata.
- **Pipeline intelligence upgrade**: graph extraction v6 with few-shot examples, relation catalog expanded from 49 to 88 standard relation types, semantic chunking (2800 chars, 10% overlap, heading-aware), boilerplate detection, quality scoring, entity resolution, document summaries, and post-extraction type refinement.
- **Hybrid search**: BM25 + vector cosine similarity merged via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) with field-weighted scoring (heading boost 1.5x, quality score multiplier).
- **21 MCP tools**: added `ask` (grounded Q&A), `search_entities`, `get_graph_topology`, `list_relations`, `list_documents`, `delete_document`. Token-efficient responses with `includeReferences=false` by default.
- **Canvas2D graph renderer**: replaced SVG with Canvas2D for rendering 10K+ nodes and 50K+ edges. Zero React re-renders during pan/zoom. Viewport culling, level-of-detail labels, adaptive edge budget.
- **Bulk document actions**: batch delete, cancel processing, and reprocess via UI selection mode and REST endpoints.

### Pipeline

- Graph extraction prompt v6 with comprehensive entity type guidance, coreference resolution rules, and 2 few-shot examples.
- Relation catalog expanded from 49 to 88 standard relation types: `calls`, `implements`, `extends`, `authenticates`, `contains`, `returns`, `validates`, `transforms`, `deployed_on`, `inherits_from`, `imports`, and 27 more.
- Post-extraction type refinement: regex-based pass auto-reclassifies env vars, URL paths, HTTP methods, file paths, and status codes from generic `entity` to specific types.
- Post-extraction mentions reduction: summary-based heuristic upgrades `mentions` to `uses`, `depends_on`, `contains`, `defines`, `provides`, `authenticates`, and other specific types when the summary text implies a concrete relationship.
- Semantic chunking: increased default from 1,600 to 2,800 chars, added 10% overlap between adjacent chunks, heading-aware splitting (headings always start new chunks).
- Boilerplate detection: nav links, breadcrumbs, cookie banners, copyright notices filtered from chunking.
- Chunk quality scoring: 0.0-1.0 score based on text length, word diversity, heading/code/table presence.
- SimHash near-duplicate detection for chunk deduplication.
- Document-level summary generation from structured blocks during ingestion.
- Entity resolution service: deterministic merge by exact alias, normalized prefix, and acronym detection.
- Graph extraction parallelism bumped from max 4 to max 8 concurrent chunks.
- Query expansion: 24 synonym groups for automatic search term broadening.
- Extended technical fact extraction: 8 new fact kinds (environment variables, version numbers, database names, configuration keys, error codes, rate limits, dependency declarations, code identifiers).
- Entity summary upsert changed from last-write-wins to longest-wins.
- Verification feedback loop: warnings from answer verification now flow into the response instead of being silently discarded.
- Error handling: replaced silent `let _ =` patterns in ingestion worker with proper error logging for `promote_document_head`, entity resolution, and document summary generation.

### MCP

- Added `ask` tool: grounded Q&A in a single call (replaces 3-call workflow of create_session + create_turn + get_execution).
- Added `list_documents` tool: browse library contents with optional status filter.
- Added `delete_document` tool: complete CRUD lifecycle for agents.
- Added `search_entities` tool: search knowledge graph entities by label.
- Added `get_graph_topology` tool: graph structure with truncation limits (default 200 entities / 500 relations).
- Added `list_relations` tool: explore graph relationships ordered by support count.
- `search_documents` and `read_document` responses now default to `includeReferences=false`, reducing token usage by ~80%.
- Fixed `list_relations` description (was misleading about query parameter).
- Updated MCP.md and MCP-RU.md with all 21 tools organized by category.

### Frontend

- **Graph page**: Canvas2D renderer replaces SVG. Handles 10K+ nodes at interactive frame rates. Edge labels for selected node connections. 10 distinct entity type colors with updated legend and type filter dropdown. Level-of-detail label rendering. Adaptive edge budget scaling with zoom.
- **Graph page**: all pan/zoom/hover interactions use refs instead of React state — zero re-renders during interaction.
- **Documents page**: selection mode with checkboxes, select-all, and sticky bulk action toolbar (delete, cancel processing, retry). i18n translations for en/ru.
- **Assistant page**: Markdown renderer for answer messages (code blocks, tables, lists). Removed cosmetic attachment UI.
- **Dashboard page**: renders API metrics; web ingest activity strip wired.
- GraphNodeType contract: 10 universal entity types across contracts crate, API mapping, and frontend.

### Backend

- Batch document endpoints: `POST /content/documents/batch-delete`, `batch-cancel`, `batch-reprocess` (max 100 per call).
- Ingestion worker: skip-deleted document guard, skip-cancelled job guard.
- ArangoDB relation type bug fix: `predicate` field now correctly maps to `relationType` in REST API responses.
- BM25 field-weighted scoring: heading_trail matches boosted 1.5x, section_path 1.3x, quality_score multiplier.
- quality_score persisted to ArangoDB `KnowledgeChunkRow`.
- Async reranking infrastructure (rerank_structured_query made async).
- RRF hybrid search fusion in `merge_chunks`.

### Benchmarks

- Golden benchmark corpus: 72 files across 5 semantic directories (wikipedia, docs, code, documents, fixtures).
- 10 benchmark suites with 102 test cases covering: Wikipedia recall, cross-document QA, noisy layouts, graph traversal, multiformat upload, programming docs, infrastructure docs, protocols, code comprehension, and PDF/DOCX/PPTX extraction.

- **Backend vocabulary consolidation**: eliminated all legacy `project_id` vocabulary, collapsed dual-head revision semantics, removed 63 clippy dead-code warnings, achieved green `make backend-lint` for the first time.
- **Billing pipeline**: added cost tracking for graph extraction and query execution. Per-document and per-library cost summaries displayed in UI.
- **Entity references in queries**: answers now include matched knowledge graph entities with labels and types.
- **Source attribution**: segment references include document title and source URI, enabling users to trace answers back to specific documents and web pages.
- **Docker-first deployment**: separate frontend and backend images, nginx reverse proxy, one-command `docker compose up -d`.

### Architecture

- Replaced `apps/web` Leptos crate with React SPA (Vite + TypeScript strict mode).
- Removed `vendor/thaw-0.5.0-beta` patched UI library and all Leptos/leptos_axum dependencies.
- Frontend served as separate nginx container; API proxied through nginx reverse proxy.
- Added `apps/web/Dockerfile` for multi-stage Node build → nginx static serve.

- Shell bootstrap loads libraries from all visible workspaces.

### Backend

- Renamed all `project_id` to `library_id` across 17 repository functions, 5 service files, all callers.
- Replaced `DocumentRow`/`ChunkRow` shadow vocabulary: `current_revision_id` → `active_revision_id`, `active_status` → `document_state`, `active_mutation_kind/status` → `mutation_kind/status`.
- Added `ContentDocumentHead::effective_revision_id()` and `latest_revision_id()` methods replacing ad-hoc fallback patterns.
- Removed dead code: entire `document_accounting.rs`, 30+ unused functions from `ingestion_worker.rs`, `runtime_ingestion.rs`, `graph_extract.rs`.
- Added billing capture for graph extraction embeddings and query execution embeddings.
- Rewrote billing queries to aggregate costs from all execution kinds (graph_extraction + ingest_attempt).
- Added PostgreSQL-based entity search fallback for query pipeline when ArangoDB entities are empty.
- Added `documentTitle` and `sourceUri` to `PreparedSegmentReference` in query responses.

### Frontend

- 8 pages: Dashboard, Documents, Graph, AI Assistant, Admin, Swagger (live OpenAPI), Login, 404.
- API layer with typed clients: `auth`, `documents`, `dashboard`, `query`, `knowledge`, `admin`, `billing`.
- i18n with `react-i18next`: full English and Russian translations across all pages.
- Interactive knowledge graph: force-directed layout, 8 layout modes, draggable nodes, curved edges, adjacency-based selection highlighting, adaptive labels, document-entity connections.

## 0.0.4 - 2026-04-04

### Highlights

- Added GitHub Release automation around the published Docker Hub release channel used by the Rust-only stack.
- Split Compose surfaces into one default prebuilt deployment path, one manual local-build path, and one internal GitLab deployment path.
- Added one-click `install.sh` installation without cloning the repository, with release-tag or `latest` resolution from GitHub.
- Cut query and extraction orchestration over to one typed agent runtime with runtime-backed lifecycle, stage trace, and policy summaries across REST, MCP, and the assistant UI.

### Platform

- Switched the default `[docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml)` to published Docker Hub images so release installs no longer depend on local image builds.
- Historical note: the legacy deployment surface `docker-compose-gitlab.yml` was removed (deleted); active compose files are now `[docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml)` and `[docker-compose-local.yml](./docker-compose-local.yml)`.
- Updated root env documentation and release docs around the primary `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose-local.yml` split.
- Tracked the repo-root `[Cargo.lock](./Cargo.lock)` in release artifacts so clean GitHub checkouts can build the API Docker image without missing-file failures.
- Added the `apps/api/src/agent_runtime/` subsystem with typed task contracts, staged execution, explicit policy decisions, and owner-linked runtime persistence.
- Replaced full-library graph rebuilds during ingestion with targeted graph reconciliation.
- Reworked knowledge generation and operations read models around primary revision readiness.

### Product

- Assistant execution surfaces now render runtime lifecycle, stage summaries, policy interventions, and explicit policy-rejected or policy-terminated outcomes instead of generic failures.
- Documents, Dashboard, Graph, and auth surfaces were rebalanced around the primary workbench layout.

### Reliability And Performance

- Fixed long-running document ingestion stalls by eliminating graph-persistence races in primary merge/write paths.
- Restored truthful operator state reporting so idle libraries now surface `healthy` plus `graph_ready`.

## 0.0.3 - 2026-04-03
