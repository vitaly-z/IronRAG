# IronRAG frontend

This document describes the current web frontend structure and the QA contract for `apps/web`.

## Directory layout

```text

├── api/           Thin HTTP clients for `/v1/*`
├── components/    Reusable view components and feature widgets
├── contexts/      Global app state such as active workspace and library
├── hooks/         Cross-page React hooks
├── lib/           Non-React utilities

└── types/         Canonical frontend domain types
```

## Canonical frontend contracts

- `api/*` talks to the backend and returns wire payloads or already-normalized DTOs.
- `adapters/*` are the only place where Raw API envelopes become domain models.
- `pages/*` orchestrate data loading, routing state, and page-owned derived state.
- `components/*` render; they do not own transport logic.
- Page-specific helpers stay next to the page under `pages/{feature}/`.
- Shared primitives in `components/ui/*` remain presentation-only.

## Page ownership

### Dashboard

- Uses `/v1/ops/libraries/{libraryId}/dashboard` and `/v1/ops/libraries/{libraryId}`.
- Derives summary cards, health rows, recent documents, and ingest status from one dashboard payload.
- Refresh must update only the affected widgets.

### Documents

- Owns the keyset-paginated document list, uploads, batch actions, inspector, web-run list, and editor entry.
- Uses standard list pagination via `/v1/content/documents`.
- Rows render active ingest progress from the document list payload; the UI does not need a second polling lane for per-row percentages.
- Inspector detail, prepared segments, technical facts, revisions, and source download all load from dedicated endpoints.
- Inspector pipeline state renders from stage read-model data: stage status, progress, duration, model, cost, provider-call count, and extraction/chunk details.
- Batch rerun progress polls `/v1/ops/operations/{operationId}`.

### Assistant

- Owns session list, active session, message history, pending-turn state, and debug context.
- Uses `/v1/query/sessions/*` for session CRUD and turn execution.
- Turn execution uses one canonical `POST /v1/query/sessions/{sessionId}/turns` request. The UI requests `text/event-stream` so activity, failure, and completion events can update the pending answer bubble while the completed answer remains the persisted session/execution record.
- If the browser or proxy drops the stream after backend work has started, the client reloads the durable session result created after the request boundary instead of submitting another turn. Backend `failed` events remain terminal errors.
- LLM context debug loads persisted execution snapshots, not process-local cache, so reloads and cached answer replays remain inspectable when a snapshot exists.

### Graph

- Loads topology from `/v1/knowledge/libraries/{libraryId}/graph`.
- Loads summary from `/v1/knowledge/libraries/{libraryId}/summary`.
- Loads entity detail on selection from `/v1/knowledge/libraries/{libraryId}/entities/{entityId}`.
- Adjacency lookup is centralized so inspector neighbor resolution stays bounded to the selected node neighborhood.
- Layout computation runs in a Web Worker at 3000+ nodes. First canvas paint is ~1.6 s on a 25k-node graph.
- Node labels are disabled above 15k nodes. Layout animation is skipped above 5k nodes.
- Hidden-edge precompute and O(degree) selection keep interaction responsive on large graphs.

### Admin

- Uses `/v1/admin/surface` as the shell bootstrap.
- Access, AI, pricing, audit, MCP prompt, snapshot, and catalog operations each own their own fetch path.
- Tabs mount lazily; inactive tabs must not keep refetching.

### Swagger

- The `/swagger` route embeds `/swagger.html` in an iframe.
- Swagger UI vendor CSS is isolated from the Tailwind app shell; the page loads the generated OpenAPI JSON through the frontend origin.

## Frontend quality gates

### Static and unit tests

```bash
cd apps/web
npm run lint
npm test
```

### Visual QA

```bash
cd apps/web
QA_LOGIN=admin QA_PASSWORD='<password>' \
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=$HOME/.cache/ms-playwright \
npx playwright test --config=playwright.qa.config.ts
```

The Playwright suite captures the live UI at desktop and constrained mobile viewports and stores screenshots under `apps/web/visual-qa/screenshots/`.

### Manual checkpoints

Use at least these viewport classes during manual QA:

| Viewport | Example size | Main checks |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | `375x812` | stacked layout, horizontal overflow, drawer sizing |
| Tablet | `768x1024` | sidebar collapse, tab and panel wrapping |
| Desktop | `1440x900` | default operator workflow |
| Wide | `1920x1080` | multi-column surfaces, graph inspector width |

Verify these behaviors:

- Dashboard refresh does not rebuild the whole page.
- Documents table remains usable on narrow widths and web-run rows expand inline.
- Assistant streaming updates only the active answer bubble, keeps scroll behavior stable, and does not duplicate a turn during transport recovery.
- Graph selection changes inspector state without refetching the topology stream.
- Admin tabs fetch only their own data and remain usable on narrow widths.

## Visual failure bar

The frontend is not done when TypeScript compiles. It is done when:

- layouts hold at desktop and constrained widths,
- long-running surfaces keep stable rendering during polling or streaming,
- empty, loading, and error states are legible,
- no page depends on Raw wire parsing inside the render tree.
