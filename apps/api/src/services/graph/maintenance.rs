//! Per-library debounce for graph maintenance passes (entity resolution,
//! community detection, community summary generation).
//!
//! A background worker loop runs a library-wide maintenance pass: entity
//! resolution, community detection, and a batch of LLM calls for community
//! summaries. That work is idempotent and operates on the whole graph, so
//! keeping it out of the per-document ingest critical path prevents one large
//! graph from holding an ingest lease after the document projection is already
//! ready.
//!
//! This module squashes that burst down to a single pass per library
//! per [`MAINTENANCE_INTERVAL`] window. The worker loop claims the slot via
//! [`try_acquire_graph_maintenance_slot`] and runs the full pass; concurrent
//! ticks see the slot already claimed and skip the block entirely. The
//! maintenance work remains correct because graph projection is committed
//! before document finalization and maintenance only has to eventually catch
//! up with that canonical graph state.
//!
//! The throttle lives in process-local state (a `Mutex<HashMap>`)
//! because it guards a process-local CPU hot path — cross-worker
//! coordination would introduce a DB round-trip on a fast path that
//! we specifically want to avoid.
//!
//! No configuration knobs on purpose: a process-local debounce is only
//! as good as its tuning, and the right value is "however long one
//! maintenance pass takes, plus a small cushion." 30 s comfortably
//! covers a mid-sized library (tens of thousands of nodes and edges,
//! on the order of a hundred communities).
